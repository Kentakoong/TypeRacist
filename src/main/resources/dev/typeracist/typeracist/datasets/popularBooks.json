  "I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\nand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\nperpetual splendour. Therefor with your leave, my sister, I will put\nsome trust in preceding navigatorsthere snow and frost are banished;\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\nglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\nsolitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.",
  "These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\na steady purposea point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\neye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\nthrough the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas library. My education was neglected,\nyet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my fathers dying injunction\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.",
  "These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.",
  "Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\ngreat enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\nI voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\nthe greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an\nunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\nmust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.",
  "And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\nvoice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\nwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.",
  "This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in fursa dress which I have\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\nArchangel.",
  "I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\nsail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\ncan I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\nwill pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\nor never.",
  "How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a\nvessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\nalready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\npossessed of dauntless courage.",
  "But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\nwill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\none will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\nfeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\nbitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas books of voyages.\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\nendeavour to regulate my mind.",
  "Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\nin my enterprise.",
  "The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\nme very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\nhappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\nand that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\nwomans father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\ninclinations. What a noble fellow! you will exclaim. He is\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\notherwise he would command.",
  "Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\nwavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\nsooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\nsafety of others is committed to my care.",
  "I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\nundertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\nI am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to the\nland of mist and snow, but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\nwoeful as the Ancient Mariner. You will smile at my allusion, but I\nwill disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\nat work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically\nindustriouspainstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\nlabourbut besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\nregions I am about to explore.",
  "But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\nAfrica or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\nlook on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\nI need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly.\nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.",
  "I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safeand well advanced\non my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on\nits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not\nsee my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good\nspirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the\nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\nof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We\nhave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of\nsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,\nwhich blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not\nexpected.",
  "But success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I\nhave gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars\nthemselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not\nstill proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the\ndetermined heart and resolved will of man?",
  "Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed\nin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which\nshe floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we\nwere compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,\nhoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.",
  "About two oclock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out\nin every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to\nhave no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\ngrow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\nattracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\nsituation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\ndogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\nbeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\nsat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress\nof the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\ndistant inequalities of the ice.",
  "This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,\nmany hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that\nit was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by\nice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\ngreatest attention.",
  "About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\nnight the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the\nmorning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which\nfloat about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to\nrest for a few hours.",
  "In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\nfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\ntalking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\nhad seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\nfragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\nbeing within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\nHe was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\nsome undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the\nmaster said, Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\non the open sea.",
  "You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\nto me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\nsupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\nhave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I\nreplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\nnorthern pole.",
  "Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\nGood God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\nhis safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were\nnearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\nsuffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted\nto carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\nair he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\nrestored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\nswallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we\nwrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\nkitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\nwhich restored him wonderfully.",
  "Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\nfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he\nhad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\nattended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more\ninteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of\nwildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\nperforms an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\ntrifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\na beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he\nis generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\nteeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.",
  "When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off\nthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\nallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\nand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\nOnce, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\nin so strange a vehicle.",
  "This aroused the strangers attention, and he asked a multitude of\nquestions concerning the route which the dmon, as he called him, had\npursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, I have,\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\npeople; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.",
  "Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\nice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer\nwith any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\nmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\nbefore that time; but of this I could not judge.",
  "From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\nstranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\nthe sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\nthe cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\nI have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant\nnotice if any new object should appear in sight.",
  "Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\npresent day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very\nsilent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.\nYet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\ninterested in him, although they have had very little communication\nwith him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\nconstant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must\nhave been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck\nso attractive and amiable.",
  "My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my\nadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so\nnoble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\ngrief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\nwhen he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,\nyet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.",
  "He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,\napparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although\nunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he\ninterests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently\nconversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without\ndisguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my\neventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken\nto secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\nlanguage of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul\nand to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would\nsacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my\nenterprise. One mans life or death were but a small price to pay for\nthe acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should\nacquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a\ndark gloom spread over my listeners countenance. At first I\nperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before\nhis eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle\nfast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I\npaused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: Unhappy man! Do you\nshare my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;\nlet me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!",
  "Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\nhimself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\ndespair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked\nme the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it\nawakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a\nfriend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than\nhad ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could\nboast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.",
  "I agree with you, replied the stranger; we are\nunfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than\nourselvessuch a friend ought to bedo not lend his aid to\nperfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most\nnoble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting\nfriendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for\ndespair. But II have lost everything and cannot begin life\nanew.",
  "Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he\ndoes the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\nafforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of\nelevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he\nmay suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he\nhas retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a\nhalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.",
  "Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine\nwanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and\nrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore\nsomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to\nappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I\nhave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that\nelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I\nbelieve it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing\npower of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled\nfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a\nvoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.",
  "Yesterday the stranger said to me, You may easily perceive, Captain\nWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had\ndetermined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with\nme, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for\nknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the\ngratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine\nhas been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be\nuseful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same\ncourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me\nwhat I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one\nthat may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you\nin case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually\ndeemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might\nfear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things\nwill appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would\nprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers\nof nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series\ninternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.",
  "You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered\ncommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by\na recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear\nthe promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong\ndesire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed\nthese feelings in my answer.",
  "I thank you, he replied, for your sympathy, but it is\nuseless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I\nshall repose in peace. I understand your feeling, continued he,\nperceiving that I wished to interrupt him; but you are mistaken, my\nfriend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my\ndestiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is\ndetermined.",
  "He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I\nshould be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have\nresolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to\nrecord, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during\nthe day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This\nmanuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who\nknow him, and who hear it from his own lipswith what interest and\nsympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my\ntask, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me\nwith all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in\nanimation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul\nwithin. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which\nembraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked itthus!",
  "I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\ndistinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years\ncounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\nsituations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who\nknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\nbusiness. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\naffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\nhusband and the father of a family.",
  "As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\nrefrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a\nmerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\nmischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\nproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\ndaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\nwretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\nwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\nHe bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\nso little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in\nendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\nthe world again through his credit and assistance.",
  "Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\nmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\nhe hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\nReuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\nhad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\nit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\nthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\nmerchants house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\nhis grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\nreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\nof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.",
  "His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\nwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\nthere was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort\npossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\nher in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\nby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\nsupport life.",
  "Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\nher an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\nby Beauforts coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\nchamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\ncommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\nconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\nrelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.",
  "There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\nthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\naffection. There was a sense of justice in my fathers upright mind\nwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\nstrongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\nlate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\na greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and\nworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\nvirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\nher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\nto his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes\nand her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\nsheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\nwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\nbenevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\nconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\ntheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\nof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\nas a restorative for her weakened frame.",
  "From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\nat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\nfor several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\nother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\nmine of love to bestow them upon me. My mothers tender caresses and\nmy fathers smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\nfirst recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\nbettertheir child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\nthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\ntheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\ntheir duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\ntowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\nof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\nevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\nand of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\none train of enjoyment to me.",
  "For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\ndaughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five\nyears old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\npassed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\ndisposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my\nmother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\npassionremembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\nrelievedfor her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\nafflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\nattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\nof half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\nshape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\naccompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,\nhard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\nfive hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far\nabove all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were\ndark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her\nhair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her\nclothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was\nclear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of\nher face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold\nher without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,\nand bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.",
  "The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\nadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was\nnot her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a\nGerman and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with\nthese good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been\nlong married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their\ncharge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory\nof Italyone among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted\nhimself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its\nweakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria\nwas not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\na beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude\nabode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.",
  "When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of\nour villa a child fairer than pictured cheruba creature who seemed\nto shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter\nthan the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his\npermission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their\ncharge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed\na blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\nand want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They\nconsulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza\nbecame the inmate of my parents housemy more than\nsisterthe beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and\nmy pleasures.",
  "Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential\nattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my\npride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to\nmy home, my mother had said playfully, I have a pretty present for my\nVictortomorrow he shall have it. And when, on the morrow, she\npresented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish\nseriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth\nas minemine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on\nher I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other\nfamiliarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body\nforth the kind of relation in which she stood to memy more than\nsister, since till death she was to be mine only.",
  "We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\nour ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\ndisunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\nnearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss\nhome the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\nour Alpine summersshe found ample scope for admiration and delight.\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\ncauses. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\nearliest sensations I can remember.",
  "On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\ncountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\nleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\ntalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\nof the infidels.",
  "No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.\nWe felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to\ntheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\nwhich we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly\ndiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted\nthe development of filial love.",
  "My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\nlaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\nindiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,\nnor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\npossessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth\nthat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\nthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\nthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\nor in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.",
  "Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\nrelations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was\nto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul\nof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.\nHer sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of\nher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become\nsullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that\nshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And\nClervalcould aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\ngenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\nbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\nambition.",
  "I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,\nbefore misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,\nin drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which\nled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would\naccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my\ndestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost\nforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent\nwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.",
  "Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\npredilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went\non a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the\nweather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I\nchanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it\nwith apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful\nfacts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new\nlight seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\ndiscovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my\nbook and said, Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste\nyour time upon this; it is sad trash.",
  "If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me\nthat the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern\nsystem of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers\nthan the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while\nthose of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I\nshould certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my\nimagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my\nformer studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never\nhave received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance\nmy father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was\nacquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest\navidity.",
  "When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this\nauthor, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and\nstudied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me\ntreasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always\nhaving been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of\nnature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern\nphilosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.\nSir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking\nup shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his\nsuccessors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted\nappeared even to my boys apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same\npursuit.",
  "The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted\nwith their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little\nmore. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal\nlineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,\nanatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\nin their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I\nhad gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep\nhuman beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and\nignorantly I had repined.",
  "But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew\nmore. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their\ndisciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth\ncentury; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of\nGeneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite\nstudies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a\nchilds blindness, added to a students thirst for knowledge.\nUnder the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest\ndiligence into the search of the philosophers stone and the elixir\nof life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an\ninferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could\nbanish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but\na violent death!",
  "Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a\npromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which\nI most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I\nattributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a\nwant of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was\noccupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand\ncontradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of\nmultifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish\nreasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.",
  "When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near\nBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It\nadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once\nwith frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,\nwhile the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.\nAs I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an\nold and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so\nsoon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing\nremained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found\nthe tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the\nshock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld\nanything so utterly destroyed.",
  "Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of\nelectricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural\nphilosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on\nthe explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of\nelectricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.\nAll that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,\nAlbertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by\nsome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my\naccustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever\nbe known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew\ndespicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps\nmost subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former\noccupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed\nand abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a\nwould-be science which could never even step within the threshold of\nreal knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the\nmathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as\nbeing built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.",
  "Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments\nare we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me\nas if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the\nimmediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my lifethe last effort\nmade by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even\nthen hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was\nannounced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which\nfollowed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting\nstudies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with\ntheir prosecution, happiness with their disregard.",
  "When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had\nhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it\nnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be made\nacquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My\ndeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day\nresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life\noccurredan omen, as it were, of my future misery.",
  "Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was\nin the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first\nyielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her\nfavourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She\nattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity\nof the distemperElizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this\nimprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother\nsickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the\nlooks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her\ndeathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert\nher. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. My\nchildren, she said, my firmest hopes of future happiness were\nplaced on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the\nconsolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to\nmy younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy\nand beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are\nnot thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to\ndeath and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.",
  "She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.\nI need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent\nby that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the\nsoul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so\nlong before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day\nand whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed\nfor everthat the brightness of a beloved eye can have been\nextinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear\ncan be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of\nthe first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the\nevil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has\nnot that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I\ndescribe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at\nlength arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and\nthe smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a\nsacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still\nduties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the\nrest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the\nspoiler has not seized.",
  "My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,\nwas now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of\nsome weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,\nakin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of\nlife. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was\nunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above\nall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.",
  "She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.\nShe looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and\nzeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call\nher uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,\nwhen she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.\nShe forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.",
  "The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last\nevening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit\nhim to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His\nfather was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the\naspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune\nof being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when\nhe spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a\nrestrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details\nof commerce.",
  "We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor\npersuade ourselves to say the word Farewell! It was said, and we\nretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the\nother was deceived; but when at mornings dawn I descended to the\ncarriage which was to convey me away, they were all theremy father\nagain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to\nrenew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last\nfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.",
  "I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in\nthe most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by\namiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual\npleasureI was now alone. In the university whither I was going I\nmust form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto\nbeen remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible\nrepugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and\nClerval; these were old familiar faces, but I believed myself\ntotally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as\nI commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I\nardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,\nthought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\nlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.\nNow my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to\nrepent.",
  "The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to\nsome of the principal professors. Chanceor rather the evil\ninfluence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me\nfrom the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my fathers\ndoorled me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He\nwas an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He\nasked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches\nof science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and\npartly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal\nauthors I had studied. The professor stared. Have you, he\nsaid, really spent your time in studying such nonsense?",
  "I replied in the affirmative. Every minute, continued M. Krempe with\nwarmth, every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\nand entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\nand useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,\nwhere no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\nhave so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\nare ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific\nage, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear\nsir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.",
  "So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\ntreating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and\ndismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\nweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\nphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\nprofessor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he\nomitted.",
  "I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\nconsidered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\nreturned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\nshape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\nrepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\nfavour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a\nstrain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\nto concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been\ncontent with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\nscience. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\nextreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\nsteps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\ndiscoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.\nBesides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.\nIt was very different when the masters of the science sought\nimmortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now\nthe scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\nitself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\nscience was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of\nboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.",
  "Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\nresidence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\nacquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\nabode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\nwhich M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I\ncould not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\nsentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.",
  "Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing\nroom, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very\nunlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an\naspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his\ntemples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person\nwas short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.\nHe began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and\nthe various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing\nwith fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took\na cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\nits elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he\nconcluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I\nshall never forget:",
  "The ancient teachers of this science, said he,\npromised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters\npromise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\nthe elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem\nonly made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\ncrucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses\nof nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the\nheavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of\nthe air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;\nthey can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even\nmock the invisible world with its own shadows.",
  "Such were the professors wordsrather let me say such the words of\nthe fateenounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul\nwere grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\ntouched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\nsounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\none purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\nFrankensteinmore, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\nalready marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\nunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.",
  "I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\nhad no power to produce it. By degrees, after the mornings dawn,\nsleep came. I awoke, and my yesternights thoughts were as a dream.\nThere only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\ndevote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\nnatural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His\nmanners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\nfor there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\nhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I\ngave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\ngiven to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little\nnarration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\nAgrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\nexhibited. He said that These were men to whose indefatigable zeal\nmodern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\nknowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\nand arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The\nlabours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\nfail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind. I\nlistened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\nor affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\nprejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\nterms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\ninstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\nmade me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\nlabours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\nprocure.",
  "I am happy, said M. Waldman, to have gained a\ndisciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of\nyour success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the\ngreatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that\nI have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\nneglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry\nchemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your\nwish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty\nexperimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural\nphilosophy, including mathematics.",
  "He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his\nvarious machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and\npromising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in\nthe science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of\nbooks which I had requested, and I took my leave.",
  "From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\nmost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\nI read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\nwhich modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the\nlectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\nuniversity, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\nand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\nphysiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In\nM. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by\ndogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\ngood nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways\nhe smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at\nfirst fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\nsoon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\nlight of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.",
  "As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\nwas rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\nmy proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,\nwith a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\nexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years\npassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\nengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\nhoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive\nof the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\na scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\nA mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\ninfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\ncontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\nsolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\nyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\ninstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\nuniversity. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\nhappened that protracted my stay.",
  "One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\nthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\nlife. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\nIt was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\nmystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\nacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\ninquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\nthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\nnatural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\nstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the\ncauses of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became\nacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\nmust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\nIn my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\nmind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever\nremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\nthe apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\na churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\nlife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\nfood for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\nthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\ncharnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most\ninsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the\nfine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\ndeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\ninherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and\nanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\nfrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\ndarkness a sudden light broke in upon mea light so brilliant and\nwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\nof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\nscience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\nsecret.",
  "Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not\nmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\ntrue. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\ndiscovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of\nincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\ngeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\nanimation upon lifeless matter.",
  "The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\nsoon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in\npainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\nmost gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so\ngreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\nprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\nWhat had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\nof the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it\nall opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\ntowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\naccomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\nand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\nineffectual light.",
  "I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\nwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end\nof my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\nsubject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,\nto your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my\nprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\nknowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\nto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\nwill allow.",
  "When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\na long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.\nAlthough I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to\nprepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of\nfibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable\ndifficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the\ncreation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my\nimagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to\ndoubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful\nas man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\nadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\nultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\noperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\nimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\nplace in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present\nattempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor\ncould I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\nargument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I\nbegan the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts\nformed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\nintention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\nabout eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having\nformed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\ncollecting and arranging my materials, I began.",
  "No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\na hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death\nappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\npour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless\nme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\nowe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his\nchild so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these\nreflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\nmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\nrenew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.",
  "These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\nwith unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\nperson had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very\nbrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\nnext day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone\npossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\ngazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\neagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive\nthe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\nof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\nclay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\nthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\nto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was\nindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\nacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\nreturned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and\ndisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\nframe. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\nand separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\ntheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The\ndissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\nand often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\nwhilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\nbrought my work near to a conclusion.",
  "The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\none pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\nbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\nvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the\nsame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\nto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\nnot seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\nwell remembered the words of my father: I know that while you are\npleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\nhear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any\ninterruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties\nare equally neglected.",
  "I knew well therefore what would be my fathers feelings, but I could\nnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\nhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it\nwere, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection\nuntil the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,\nshould be completed.",
  "I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect\nto vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was\njustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from\nblame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\npeaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\ndisturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\nis an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself\nhas a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for\nthose simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\nstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human\nmind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit\nwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic\naffections, Greece had not been enslaved, Csar would have spared his\ncountry, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the\nempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.",
  "My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my\nsilence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.\nWinter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not\nwatch the blossom or the expanding leavessights which before always\nyielded me supreme delightso deeply was I engrossed in my\noccupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near\nto a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had\nsucceeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared\nrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\nunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.\nEvery night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most\npainful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow\ncreatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at\nthe wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone\nsustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and\namusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself\nboth of these when my creation should be complete.",
  "It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\nof my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.",
  "How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\nform? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\nbeautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered\nthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\nblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\nluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\nthat seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\nthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.",
  "The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings\nof human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\npurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had\ndeprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour\nthat far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty\nof the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my\nheart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I\nrushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\nbed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude\nsucceeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\nbed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\nBut it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\ndreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in\nthe streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,\nbut as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\nthe hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\nheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her\nform, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.\nI started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\nteeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\nyellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\nshutters, I beheld the wretchthe miserable monster whom I had\ncreated. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\nmay be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some\ninarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have\nspoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\ndetain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the\ncourtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\nduring the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\nagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\nit were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I\nhad so miserably given life.",
  "Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy\nagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I\nhad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those\nmuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\nsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.",
  "I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\nhardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\nsank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with\nthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had\nbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a\nhell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!",
  "Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my\nsleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple\nand clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates\nof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into\nthe streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the\nwretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my\nview. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but\nfelt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured\nfrom a black and comfortless sky.",
  "I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by\nbodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I\ntraversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or\nwhat I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I\nhurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:\n\nLike one who, on a lonely road,\nDoth walk in fear and dread,\nAnd, having once turned round, walks on,\nAnd turns no more his head;\nBecause he knows a frightful fiend\nDoth close behind him tread.\n\n[Coleridges Ancient Mariner.]",
  "Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\ndiligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;\nbut I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming\ntowards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed\nthat it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and\non the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,\ninstantly sprung out. My dear Frankenstein, exclaimed he,\nhow glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at\nthe very moment of my alighting!",
  "Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back\nto my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear\nto my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror\nand misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,\ncalm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial\nmanner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for\nsome time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being\npermitted to come to Ingolstadt. You may easily believe, said\nhe, how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all\nnecessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;\nand, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant\nanswer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch\nschoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: I have ten thousand florins\na year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek. But his\naffection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has\npermitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of\nknowledge.",
  "Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from\nyou so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their\naccount myself. But, my dear Frankenstein, continued he, stopping\nshort and gazing full in my face, I did not before remark how very ill\nyou appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for\nseveral nights.",
  "I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to\nallude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a\nquick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and\nthe thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\napartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to\nbehold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\nEntreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\nstairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the\nlock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a\ncold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as\nchildren are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\nwaiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped\nfearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed\nfrom its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good\nfortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy\nhad indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.",
  "We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\nbut I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed\nme; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\nbeat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\nplace; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\nClerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,\nbut when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\nfor which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless\nlaughter frightened and astonished him.",
  "This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for\nseveral months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I\nafterwards learned that, knowing my fathers advanced age and unfitness\nfor so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\nElizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\ndisorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\nnurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he\ndid not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest\naction that he could towards them.",
  "But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\nunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\nThe form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\nbefore my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my\nwords surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\nof my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\ncontinually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\nindeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.",
  "By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\ngrieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became\ncapable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\nperceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\nbuds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was\na divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\nconvalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\nmy bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as\ncheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.",
  "Dearest Clerval, exclaimed I, how kind, how very good\nyou are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you\npromised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever\nrepay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I\nhave been the occasion, but you will forgive me.",
  "Compose yourself, said Clerval, who observed my change of\ncolour, I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father\nand cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your\nown handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at\nyour long silence.",
  "You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear\nkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are\nforbidden to writeto hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,\nis necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought\nthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have\nrestrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have\nprevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so\nlong a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to\nperform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on\nyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never\nguess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of\nyour poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed\nyou are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this\nintelligence soon in your own handwriting.",
  "Get welland return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and\nfriends who love you dearly. Your fathers health is vigorous, and he\nasks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a\ncare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would\nbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full\nof activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter\ninto foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his\nelder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of\na military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your\npowers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his\ntime is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the\nlake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point\nand permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.",
  "Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken\nplace since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountainsthey\nnever change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are\nregulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up\nmy time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing\nnone but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one\nchange has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on\nwhat occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;\nI will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,\nher mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the\nthird. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but\nthrough a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and\nafter the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed\nthis, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\nto allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our\ncountry have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\nprevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less\ndistinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\nlower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\nmore refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\nthing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in\nour family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\nfortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\nsacrifice of the dignity of a human being.",
  "Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\nrecollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one\nglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\nAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelicashe looked so\nfrank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\nby which she was induced to give her an education superior to that\nwhich she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;\nJustine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not\nmean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\nyou could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\nAlthough her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\nyet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She\nthought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her\nphraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.",
  "One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\nexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The\nconscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\ndeaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\npartiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\nconfirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months\nafter your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\nrepentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she\nwas much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\nand a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\nfor vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mothers house of a nature\nto restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her\nrepentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\nbut much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\nbrothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\ninto a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\nnow at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,\nat the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;\nand I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,\nand extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her\nexpression continually remind me of my dear aunt.",
  "I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling\nWilliam. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with\nsweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he\nsmiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with\nhealth. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron\nis his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.",
  "Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little\ngossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield\nhas already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching\nmarriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly\nsister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your\nfavourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes\nsince the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already\nrecovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a\nlively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much\nolder than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with\neverybody.",
  "I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety\nreturns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,one lineone\nword will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his\nkindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely\ngrateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat\nyou, write!",
  "Dear, dear Elizabeth! I exclaimed, when I had read her\nletter: I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety\nthey must feel. I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but\nmy convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another\nfortnight I was able to leave my chamber.",
  "One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the\nseveral professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a\nkind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had\nsustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the\nbeginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even\nto the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored\nto health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony\nof my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my\napparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he\nperceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had\npreviously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of\nno avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture\nwhen he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I\nhad made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the\nsubject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to\nmodesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science\nitself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What\ncould I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he\nhad placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\nwere to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I\nwrithed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.\nClerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the\nsensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his\ntotal ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I\nthanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly\nthat he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from\nme; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence\nthat knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in\nhim that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which\nI feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.",
  "M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of\nalmost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even\nmore pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. Dn\nthe fellow! cried he; why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has\noutstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A\nyoungster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly\nas in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if\nhe is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.Ay,\nay, continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,\nM. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.\nYoung men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was\nmyself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.",
  "Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\nliterary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He\ncame to the university with the design of making himself complete\nmaster of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for\nthe plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no\ninglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording\nscope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit\nlanguages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on\nthe same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\nwished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\ngreat relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\nonly instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I\ndid not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\nI did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\namusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\nrepaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\nelevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\nany other country. When you read their writings, life appears to\nconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,in the smiles and frowns\nof a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How\ndifferent from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!",
  "Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\nfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several\naccidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,\nand my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this\ndelay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved\nfriends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an\nunwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\nacquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent\ncheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came\nits beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.",
  "The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily\nwhich was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a\npedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a\npersonal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded\nwith pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval\nhad always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature\nthat I had taken among the scenes of my native country.",
  "We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits\nhad long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\nsalubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\nthe conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the\nintercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\nClerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught\nme to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.\nExcellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to\nelevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish\npursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\naffection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature\nwho, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.\nWhen happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most\ndelightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with\necstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring\nbloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I\nwas undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed\nupon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an\ninvincible burden.",
  "Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\nexerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled\nhis soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\nastonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in\nimitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful\nfancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew\nme out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.",
  "You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few\nlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But\nthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be\nyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\nbehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can\nI relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to\nour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent\nson? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words\nwhich are to convey to you the horrible tidings.",
  "Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\nwalk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\nour walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\non before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until\nthey should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\nhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\nafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.",
  "This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\nuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have\nreturned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with\ntorches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had\nlost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\nElizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I\ndiscovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and\nactive in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the\nprint of the murders finger was on his neck.",
  "He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\ncountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to\nsee the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,\nand entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the\nvictim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, O God! I have murdered my\ndarling child!",
  "She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again\nlived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same\nevening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable\nminiature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and\nwas doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We\nhave no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him\nare unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!",
  "Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps\ncontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;\nher words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an\nadditional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?\nYour dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live\nto witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!",
  "Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,\nbut with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of\nfestering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my\nfriend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not\nwith hatred for your enemies.",
  "During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;\nhe could only express his heartfelt sympathy. Poor William! said he,\ndear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had\nseen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his\nuntimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderers grasp! How\nmuch more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little\nfellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but\nhe is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.\nA sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer\nbe a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\nsurvivors.",
  "My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed\nto console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I\ndrew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain\nthe multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through\nscenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.\nHow altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and\ndesolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances\nmight have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were\ndone more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I\ndared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,\nalthough I was unable to define them.",
  "I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I\ncontemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the\nsnowy mountains, the palaces of nature, were not changed. By\ndegrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey\ntowards Geneva.",
  "The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I\napproached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black\nsides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a\nchild. Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your\nwanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and\nplacid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?",
  "I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on\nthese preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative\nhappiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved\ncountry! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again\nbeholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely\nlake!",
  "Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also\nclosed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still\nmore gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I\nforesaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human\nbeings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\ncircumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\nconceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.",
  "It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates\nof the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at\nSecheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky\nwas serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot\nwhere my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the\ntown, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.\nDuring this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont\nBlanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach\nrapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its\nprogress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain\ncoming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.",
  "I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\nincreased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\nover my head. It was echoed from Salve, the Juras, and the Alps of\nSavoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\nlake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\nevery thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\nfrom the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in\nSwitzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\nmost violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\nlake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of\nCopt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another\ndarkened and sometimes disclosed the Mle, a peaked mountain to the\neast of the lake.",
  "While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\na hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my\nhands, and exclaimed aloud, William, dear angel! this is thy\nfuneral, this thy dirge! As I said these words, I perceived in the\ngloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\nfixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\nilluminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\ngigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\nto humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\ndmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I\nshuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\nidea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\nchattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\npassed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\nhave destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not\ndoubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\nfact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\nanother flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\nperpendicular ascent of Mont Salve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\nsouth. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.",
  "I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still\ncontinued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I\nrevolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\nthe whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\nthe works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had\nnow nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\nwas this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a\ndepraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\nmurdered my brother?",
  "No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\nnight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not\nfeel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\nscenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast\namong mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\nof horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\nof my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\nto destroy all that was dear to me.",
  "Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were\nopen, and I hastened to my fathers house. My first thought was to\ndiscover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\nmade. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\nbeing whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\nmidnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I\nremembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\nthe time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\ndelirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that\nif any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\nlooked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature\nof the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\nas to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would\nbe pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\noverhanging sides of Mont Salve? These reflections determined me, and\nI resolved to remain silent.",
  "Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\nstood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\ndeparture for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained\nto me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\nmantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my fathers\ndesire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\nby the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\nbut there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\nsentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\ntears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\nentered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\nWelcome, my dearest Victor, said he. Ah! I wish you\nhad come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\ndelighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\nalleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\nsinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\nElizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.Poor\nWilliam! he was our darling and our pride!",
  "Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brothers eyes; a sense of mortal\nagony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the\nwretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\na not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\nminutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.",
  "I do not know what you mean, replied my brother, in accents of\nwonder, but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No\none would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be\nconvinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit\nthat Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,\ncould suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?",
  "No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\nalmost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\nconfused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\nleaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will\nthen hear all.",
  "He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William\nhad been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her\nbed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,\nhappening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the\nmurder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which\nhad been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant\ninstantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to\nany of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,\nJustine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl\nconfirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\nmanner.",
  "At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed\non his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,\nafter we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced\nsome other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,\nGood God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of\npoor William.",
  "This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\nJustine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I\nhad no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\nbrought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to\nannounce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as\nmadness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the\ncreator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the\nexistence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance\nwhich I had let loose upon the world?",
  "We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last\nbeheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\nher childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\nit was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\nShe welcomed me with the greatest affection. Your arrival, my dear\ncousin, said she, fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some\nmeans to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she\nbe convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do\nupon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only\nlost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely\nlove, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I\nnever shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;\nand then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little\nWilliam.",
  "We passed a few sad hours until eleven oclock, when the trial was to\ncommence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of\nthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to\nbe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\ncause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of\ninnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\nJustine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\nto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\nignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I\nhave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\nbeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\nexculpated her who suffered through me.",
  "The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and\nher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in\ninnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\nthousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\nexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She\nwas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\nher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the\ncourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\nseated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\nrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\nher utter guiltlessness.",
  "The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the\ncharge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined\nagainst her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof\nof her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on\nwhich the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\nperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\nmurdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she\ndid there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused\nand unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight\noclock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\nreplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\nif anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she\nfell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The\npicture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\nand when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\nwhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\nhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.",
  "God knows, she said, how entirely I am innocent. But I\ndo not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\non a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced\nagainst me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my\njudges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears\ndoubtful or suspicious.",
  "She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\nthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\nhouse of an aunt at Chne, a village situated at about a league from\nGeneva. On her return, at about nine oclock, she met a man who asked\nher if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was\nalarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\nwhen the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\nseveral hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\nunwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most\nof the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\nshe slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\nIt was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\nto find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\nit was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when\nquestioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\na sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\nConcerning the picture she could give no account.",
  "I know, continued the unhappy victim, how heavily and\nfatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\nexplaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\nto conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\nplaced in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no\nenemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\nwantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity\nafforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the\njewel, to part with it again so soon?",
  "I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\nhope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my\ncharacter, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed\nguilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\ninnocence.",
  "Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and\nthey spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they\nsupposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come\nforward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\ndispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\nwhen, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address\nthe court.",
  "I am, said she, the cousin of the unhappy child who\nwas murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived\nwith his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may\ntherefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but\nwhen I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her\npretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I\nknow of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived\nin the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly\ntwo years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\nbenevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in\nher last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards\nattended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited\nthe admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\nuncles house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was\nwarmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a\nmost affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,\nnotwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely\non her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to\nthe bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,\nI should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value\nher.",
  "A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeths simple and powerful\nappeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in\nfavour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with\nrenewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She\nherself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own\nagitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed\nin her innocence; I knew it. Could the dmon who had (I did not for a\nminute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have\nbetrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the\nhorror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and\nthe countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,\nI rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did\nnot equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of\nremorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.",
  "I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to\nthe court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal\nquestion, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my\nvisit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine\nwas condemned.",
  "I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before\nexperienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon\nthem adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the\nheart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I\naddressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.\nThat evidence, he observed, was hardly required in so glaring a\ncase, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to\ncondemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so\ndecisive.",
  "This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon\nJustines innocence. Alas! said she. How shall I\never again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as\nmy sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?\nHer mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has\ncommitted a murder.",
  "Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my\ncousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own\njudgment and feelings to decide. Yes, said Elizabeth,\nI will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany\nme; I cannot go alone. The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet\nI could not refuse.",
  "We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some\nstraw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on\nher knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with\nher, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My\ncousin wept also.",
  "Rise, my poor girl, said Elizabeth; why do you kneel,\nif you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you\nguiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had\nyourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be\nassured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a\nmoment, but your own confession.",
  "I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might\nobtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than\nall my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was\ncondemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,\nuntil I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I\nwas. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if\nI continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked\non me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?\nIn an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly\nmiserable.",
  "She paused, weeping, and then continued, I thought with horror, my\nsweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed\naunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable\nof a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.\nDear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in\nheaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I\nam to suffer ignominy and death.",
  "Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.\nWhy did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I\nwill proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony\nhearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!\nYou, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!\nNo! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.",
  "Justine shook her head mournfully. I do not fear to die, she said;\nthat pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to\nendure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember\nme and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the\nfate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to\nthe will of heaven!",
  "During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,\nwhere I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!\nWho dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass\nthe awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such\ndeep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,\nuttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When\nshe saw who it was, she approached me and said, Dear sir, you are very\nkind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?",
  "I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest\ngratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is\nthe affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than\nhalf my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my\ninnocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.",
  "Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed\ngained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the\nnever-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\nconsolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was\nthe misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\nmoon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and\ndespair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\nme which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with\nJustine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\nherself away. I wish, cried she, that I were to die with you; I\ncannot live in this world of misery.",
  "Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty\nrepressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice\nof half-suppressed emotion, Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,\nmy beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and\npreserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever\nsuffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.",
  "And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeths heart-rending eloquence\nfailed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the\ncriminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant\nappeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers\nand heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed\navowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,\nbut not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She\nperished on the scaffold as a murderess!",
  "From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\nvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my\nfathers woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was\nthe work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these\nare not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and\nthe sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!\nFrankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he\nwho would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no\nthought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear\ncountenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life\nin serving youhe bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond\nhis hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction\npause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!",
  "Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have\nbeen worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of\ninaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope\nand fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed\nfreely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my\nheart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered\nlike an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond\ndescription horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet\nbehind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.\nI had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment\nwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow\nbeings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience\nwhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and\nfrom thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and\nthe sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures\nsuch as no language can describe.",
  "My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition\nand habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his\nserene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and\nawaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.\nDo you think, Victor, said he, that I do not suffer\nalso? No one could love a child more than I loved your\nbrothertears came into his eyes as he spokebut\nis it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting\ntheir unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty\nowed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,\nor even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for\nsociety.",
  "This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I\nshould have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if\nremorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my\nother sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of\ndespair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.",
  "About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was\nparticularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at\nten oclock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that\nhour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome\nto me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had\nretired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the\nwater. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and\nsometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to\npursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I\nwas often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only\nunquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and\nheavenlyif I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and\ninterrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shoreoften,\nI say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters\nmight close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,\nwhen I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly\nloved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my\nfather and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them\nexposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose\namong them?",
  "At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my\nmind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that\ncould not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of\nunalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had\ncreated should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling\nthat all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,\nwhich by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.\nThere was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained\nbehind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of\nhim I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to\nextinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I\nreflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds\nof moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the\nAndes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished\nto see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his\nhead and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.",
  "Our house was the house of mourning. My fathers health was deeply\nshaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and\ndesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\npleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she\nthen thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted\nand destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth\nwandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our\nfuture prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from\nthe earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest\nsmiles.",
  "When I reflect, my dear cousin, said she, on the miserable death of\nJustine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before\nappeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and\ninjustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient\ndays or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to\nreason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men\nappear to me as monsters thirsting for each others blood. Yet I am\ncertainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and\nif she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly\nshe would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake\nof a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,\na child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if\nit had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human\nbeing, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to\nremain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel\nshe was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.\nAlas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can\nassure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on\nthe edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and\nendeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were\nassassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,\nand perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the\nscaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a\nwretch.",
  "I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,\nbut in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my\ncountenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, My dearest friend, you\nmust calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how\ndeeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of\ndespair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me\ntremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the\nfriends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost\nthe power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are\ntrue to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native\ncountry, we may reap every tranquil blessingwhat can disturb our\npeace?",
  "And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every\nother gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my\nheart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at\nthat very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.",
  "Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of\nheaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were\nineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial\ninfluence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting\nlimbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had\npierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.",
  "Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but\nsometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily\nexercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable\nsensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left\nmy home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought\nin the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and\nmy ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed\ntowards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my\nboyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought\nhad changed in those savage and enduring scenes.",
  "I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards\nhired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive\ninjury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the\nmiddle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\nJustine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The\nweight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in\nthe ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung\nme on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and\nthe dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\nOmnipotenceand I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less\nalmighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here\ndisplayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,\nthe valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.\nRuined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the\nimpetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\namong the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was\naugmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and\nshining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another\nearth, the habitations of another race of beings.",
  "I passed the bridge of Plissier, where the ravine, which the river\nforms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that\noverhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This\nvalley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\npicturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The\nhigh and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no\nmore ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached\nthe road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\nmarked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and\nmagnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,\nand its tremendous _dme_ overlooked the valley.",
  "A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\njourney. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\nrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\nlighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing\naccents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the\nkindly influence ceased to actI found myself fettered again to grief\nand indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my\nanimal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,\nmyselfor, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on\nthe grass, weighed down by horror and despair.",
  "At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded\nto the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.\nFor a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid\nlightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of\nthe Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds\nacted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head\nupon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed\nthe giver of oblivion.",
  "I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside\nthe sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that\nwith slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to\nbarricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before\nme; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were\nscattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\npresence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling\nwaves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\navalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\naccumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\nwas ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\ntheir hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\ngreatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me\nfrom all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my\ngrief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they\ndiverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\nlast month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\nwaited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\nhad contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the\nunstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\nand ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the cloudsthey all\ngathered round me and bade me be at peace.",
  "Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of\nsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\nthought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\nsummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\nmighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them\nin their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was\nbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\nMontanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\nand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\nIt had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\nsoul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.\nThe sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\neffect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing\ncares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\nacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\nsolitary grandeur of the scene.",
  "The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\nmountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots\nthe traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\nbroken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,\nleaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\nother trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines\nof snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\nparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking\nin a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or\nluxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.\nI looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\nwhich ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite\nmountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\npoured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I\nreceived from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of\nsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\nthem more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,\nthirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by\nevery wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may\nconvey to us.",
  "We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.\nWe rise; one wandring thought pollutes the day.\nWe feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,\nEmbrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\nIt is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,\nThe path of its departure still is free.\nMans yesterday may neer be like his morrow;\nNought may endure but mutability!",
  "It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some\ntime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered\nboth that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated\nthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very\nuneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\ninterspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a\nleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The\nopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I\nnow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\nand above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess\nof the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,\nor rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,\nwhose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering\npeaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was\nbefore sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,\nWandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow\nbeds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,\naway from the joys of life.",
  "As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\nadvancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the\ncrevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his\nstature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was\ntroubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,\nbut I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I\nperceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)\nthat it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and\nhorror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in\nmortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,\ncombined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness\nrendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely\nobserved this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,\nand I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious\ndetestation and contempt.",
  "Devil, I exclaimed, do you dare approach me? And do\nnot you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?\nBegone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,\noh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore\nthose victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!",
  "I expected this reception, said the dmon. All men hate the\nwretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all\nliving things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,\nto whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of\none of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?\nDo your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of\nmankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and\nyou at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it\nbe satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.",
  "Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred\non my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to\nincrease my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of\nanguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made\nme more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my\njoints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in\nopposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and\ndocile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,\nthe which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every\nother and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy\nclemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;\nI ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou\ndrivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I\nalone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made\nme a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.",
  "How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a\nfavourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and\ncompassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed\nwith love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my\ncreator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,\nwho owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and\ndreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the\ncaves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the\nonly one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they\nare kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind\nknew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for\nmy destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep\nno terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my\nwretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver\nthem from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that\nnot only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be\nswallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be\nmoved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard\nthat, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.\nBut hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they\nare, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen\nto me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with\na satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the\neternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,\nand then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.",
  "Why do you call to my remembrance, I rejoined, circumstances of\nwhich I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and\nauthor? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw\nlight! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!\nYou have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power\nto consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from\nthe sight of your detested form.",
  "Thus I relieve thee, my creator, he said, and placed his hated hands\nbefore my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; thus I take from\nthee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant\nme thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this\nfrom you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of\nthis place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon\nthe mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends\nto hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another\nworld, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,\nwhether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless\nlife, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of\nyour own speedy ruin.",
  "As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart\nwas full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the\nvarious arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to\nhis tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my\nresolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my\nbrother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.\nFor the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards\nhis creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I\ncomplained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with\nhis demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite\nrock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we\nentered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy\nheart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating\nmyself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began\nhis tale.",
  "It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of\nmy being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.\nA strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,\nand smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I\nlearned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By\ndegrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I\nwas obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled\nme, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now\nsuppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,\ndescended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.\nBefore, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my\ntouch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with\nno obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light\nbecame more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I\nwalked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the\nforest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting\nfrom my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This\nroused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I\nfound hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst\nat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.",
  "It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it\nwere, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted\nyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some\nclothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of\nnight. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could\ndistinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat\ndown and wept.",
  "Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of\npleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the\ntrees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,\nbut it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.\nI was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with\nwhich I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct\nideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,\nand thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on\nall sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could\ndistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with\npleasure.",
  "Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had\ngreatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each\nother. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with\ndrink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted\nwhen I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my\nears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had\noften intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,\nwith greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the\nboundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I\ntried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.\nSometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\nuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into\nsilence again.",
  "The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened\nform, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My\nsensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every\nday additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to\nperceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from\nthe herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the\nsparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and\nthrush were sweet and enticing.",
  "One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been\nleft by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the\nwarmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live\nembers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,\nI thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I\nexamined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be\ncomposed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet\nand would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the\noperation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat\ndried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching\nthe various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in\ncollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a\nplentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with\nit, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I\ncovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches\nupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank\ninto sleep.",
  "It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.\nI uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I\nobserved this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the\nembers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I\nfound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that\nthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found\nsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and\ntasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I\ntried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on\nthe live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this\noperation, and the nuts and roots much improved.",
  "Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day\nsearching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When\nI found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto\ninhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be\nmore easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the\nloss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how\nto reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of\nthis difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply\nit, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\ntowards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at\nlength discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken\nplace the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the\nappearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold\ndamp substance that covered the ground.",
  "It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\nshelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\nhad doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This\nwas a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great\ncuriosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,\nnear a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on\nhearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the\nhut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\nhardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever\nbefore seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted\nby the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not\npenetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite\nand divine a retreat as Pandmonium appeared to the dmons of hell\nafter their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the\nremnants of the shepherds breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,\nmilk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by\nfatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.",
  "It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which\nshone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\ntravels; and, depositing the remains of the peasants breakfast in a\nwallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\nat sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The\nhuts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by\nturns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\nplaced at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One\nof the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within\nthe door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\nThe whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\ngrievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\nescaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\nquite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\nbeheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat\nand pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I\ndared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\nlow that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,\nwas placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\nalthough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\nagreeable asylum from the snow and rain.",
  "Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\nhowever miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\nfrom the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my\nkennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could\nremain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back\nof the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig\nsty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had\ncrept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived\nwith stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\noccasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and\nthat was sufficient for me.",
  "Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I\nretired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\ntoo well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I\nhad first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf\nof coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink\nmore conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by\nmy retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept\nperfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was\ntolerably warm.",
  "Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\nsomething should occur which might alter my determination. It was\nindeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,\nthe rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with\npleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\nwater when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\na young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The\ngirl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\ncottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a\ncoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\nhair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost\nsight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing\nthe pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,\nseemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\ncountenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with\nan air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the\ncottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw\nthe young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field\nbehind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the\nhouse and sometimes in the yard.",
  "On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\ncottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\nfilled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\nimperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\nThrough this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean\nbut very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an\nold man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The\nyoung girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she\ntook something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat\ndown beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play\nand to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the\nnightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had\nnever beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent\ncountenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle\nmanners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\nwhich I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of\nwhich the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then\npronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt\nat his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection\nthat I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were\na mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,\neither from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the\nwindow, unable to bear these emotions.",
  "Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a\nload of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of\nhis burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on\nthe fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,\nand he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed\npleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she\nplaced in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her\nwork, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily\nemployed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed\nthus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\ncottage together.",
  "The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance\nof his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\neat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again\noccupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the\ncottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.\nNothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent\ncreatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming\nwith benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his\nfigure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his\neyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The\nold man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different\nfrom those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the\nfields.",
  "Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the\ncottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was\ndelighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the\npleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening\nthe young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\nwhich I did not understand; and the old man again took up the\ninstrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\nthe morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,\nbut to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\nharmony of the old mans instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since\nfound that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the\nscience of words or letters.",
  "I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the\noccurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners\nof these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I\nremembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from\nthe barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I\nmight hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would\nremain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the\nmotives which influenced their actions.",
  "This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.\nThe young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in\nvarious laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon\nperceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or\nin contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the\nyounger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They\nperformed towards him every little office of affection and duty with\ngentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.",
  "They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often\nwent apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,\nbut I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were\nmiserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\nshould be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They\npossessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every\nluxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands\nwhen hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\nthey enjoyed one anothers company and speech, interchanging each day\nlooks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they\nreally express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,\nbut perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which\nwere at first enigmatic.",
  "A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\nthe uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they\nsuffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment\nconsisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of\none cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters\ncould scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,\nsuffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two\nyounger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\nman when they reserved none for themselves.",
  "This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed,\nduring the night, to steal a part of their store for my own\nconsumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on\nthe cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and\nroots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.",
  "I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\ntheir labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day\nin collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often\ntook his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\nfiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.",
  "I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\nopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great\npile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the\nyouth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,\nthat he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the\ncottage and cultivating the garden.",
  "By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that\nthese people possessed a method of communicating their experience and\nfeelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words\nthey spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the\nminds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,\nand I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in\nevery attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and\nthe words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible\nobjects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the\nmystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having\nremained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I\ndiscovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of\ndiscourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and\n_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth\nand his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only\none, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or\n_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot\ndescribe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of\nthese sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other\nwords without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,\ndearest, unhappy._",
  "I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of\nthe cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I\nfelt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw\nfew human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the\ncottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\nsuperior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,\noften endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\nhe called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a\ncheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\neven upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\nwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\ngenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus\nwith Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my\nunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\nfriends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\ncheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\nman.",
  "I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked\nthe dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty\nand want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little\nwhite flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in\nthe morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that\nobstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and\nbrought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual\nastonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\nhand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring\nfarmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,\nyet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,\nbut as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old\nman and Agatha.",
  "This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I\ndiscovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when\nhe talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\nfor speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\nthese also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand\nthe sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,\nsensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\nconversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I\neasily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\nthe cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become\nmaster of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them\noverlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast\nperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.",
  "I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagerstheir grace, beauty,\nand delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself\nin a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that\nit was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became\nfully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was\nfilled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.\nAlas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable\ndeformity.",
  "As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow\nvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this\ntime Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of\nimpending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was\ncoarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.\nSeveral new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they\ndressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season\nadvanced.",
  "The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\nnot rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\nwaters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the\nearth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.",
  "My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I\nattended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in\nvarious occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in\nobserving my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any\nmoon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected\nmy own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it\nwas necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those\noffices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these\nlabours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\nonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good\nspirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification\nof these terms.",
  "My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the\nmotives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to\nknow why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought\n(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to\nthese deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the\nvenerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix\nflitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be\nthe arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a\nthousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of\nme. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle\ndemeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and\nafterwards their love.",
  "These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to\nthe acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but\nsupple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their\ntones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.\nIt was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose\nintentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved\nbetter treatment than blows and execration.",
  "The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the\naspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been\nhid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of\ncultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves\nbegan to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation\nfor gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and\nunwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of\nnature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,\nand the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.",
  "It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested\nfrom labourthe old man played on his guitar, and the children\nlistened to himthat I observed the countenance of Felix was\nmelancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father\npaused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired\nthe cause of his sons sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and\nthe old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.",
  "It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.\nThe lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black\nveil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by\npronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was\nmusical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,\nFelix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her\nveil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her\nhair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were\ndark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular\nproportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with\na lovely pink.",
  "Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of\nsorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of\necstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his\neyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\nthought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by\ndifferent feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held\nout her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as\nwell as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to\nunderstand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and\ndismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some\nconversation took place between him and his father, and the young\nstranger knelt at the old mans feet and would have kissed his hand,\nbut he raised her and embraced her affectionately.",
  "I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds\nand appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood\nby nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I\ndid not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness\nthrough the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the\nmorning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of\ndelight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed\nthe hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made\nsigns which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she\ncame. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,\nexpressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I\nfound, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger\nrepeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;\nand the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the\nsame instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty\nwords at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had\nbefore understood, but I profited by the others.",
  "As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they\nseparated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, Good night\nsweet Safie. He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and\nby the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely\nguest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to\nunderstand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found\nit utterly impossible.",
  "The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual\noccupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the\nold man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly\nbeautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my\neyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or\ndying away like a nightingale of the woods.",
  "When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first\ndeclined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in\nsweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old\nman appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to\nexplain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she\nbestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.",
  "The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration\nthat joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.\nSafie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the\nknowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most\nof the words uttered by my protectors.",
  "In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and\nthe green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the\nscent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;\nthe sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal\nrambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably\nshortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never\nventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same\ntreatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.",
  "The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volneys _Ruins\nof Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not\nFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this\nwork, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the\nEastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history\nand a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave\nme an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different\nnations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous\ngenius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue\nof the early Romansof their subsequent degeneratingof the\ndecline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard\nof the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the\nhapless fate of its original inhabitants.",
  "These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was\nman, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so\nvicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil\nprinciple and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and\ngodlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour\nthat can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on\nrecord have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more\nabject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I\ncould not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or\neven why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of\nvice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and\nloathing.",
  "Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.\nWhile I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the\nArabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I\nheard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid\npoverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.",
  "The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the\npossessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and\nunsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with\nonly one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,\nexcept in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to\nwaste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of\nmy creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I\npossessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,\nendued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even\nof the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could\nsubsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with\nless injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked\naround I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot\nupon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",
  "Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it\nhas once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to\nshake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one\nmeans to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was deatha state\nwhich I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good\nfeelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my\ncottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except\nthrough means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and\nunknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of\nbecoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the\nanimated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild\nexhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved\nFelix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!",
  "Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the\ndifference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the\nfather doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the\nolder child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up\nin the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained\nknowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which\nbind one human being to another in mutual bonds.",
  "But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my\ninfant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if\nthey had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I\ndistinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I\nthen was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being\nresembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The\nquestion again recurred, to be answered only with groans.",
  "I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to\nreturn to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various\nfeelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated\nin additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in\nan innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).",
  "The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good\nfamily in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,\nrespected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred\nin the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the\nhighest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in\na large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and\npossessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or\ntaste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.",
  "The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a\nTurkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some\nreason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.\nHe was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from\nConstantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The\ninjustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;\nand it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime\nalleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.",
  "Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and\nindignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the\ncourt. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then\nlooked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain\nadmittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an\nunguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the\nunfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the\nexecution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night\nand made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk,\namazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer\nby promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with\ncontempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit\nher father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the\nyouth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed\na treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.",
  "The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made\non the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in\nhis interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he\nshould be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to\naccept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the\nevent as to the consummation of his happiness.",
  "During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for\nthe escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several\nletters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to\nexpress her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old\nman, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in\nthe most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and\nat the same time she gently deplored her own fate.",
  "I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence\nin the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters\nwere often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will\ngive them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,\nas the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat\nthe substance of them to you.",
  "Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a\nslave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of\nthe father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and\nenthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the\nbondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in\nthe tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of\nintellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female\nfollowers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly\nimpressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again\nreturning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,\nallowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to\nthe temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble\nemulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and\nremaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in\nsociety was enchanting to her.",
  "The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night\nprevious to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant\nmany leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of\nhis father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his\nplan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under\nthe pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in\nan obscure part of Paris.",
  "Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his\ndeparture, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she\nshould be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in\nexpectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society\nof the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest\naffection. They conversed with one another through the means of an\ninterpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie\nsang to him the divine airs of her native country.",
  "The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes\nof the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other\nplans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a\nChristian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear\nlukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer\nif he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they\ninhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled\nto prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and\nsecretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans\nwere facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.",
  "The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their\nvictim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The\nplot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were\nthrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his\ndream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay\nin a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of\nher whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged\nwith the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity\nfor escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\nboarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\nhe hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\nlaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.",
  "They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I\ndiscovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for\nwhom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on\ndiscovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,\nbecame a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with\nhis daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,\nas he said, in some plan of future maintenance.",
  "Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered\nhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could\nhave endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his\nvirtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss\nof his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The\narrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.",
  "When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth\nand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her\nlover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous\nnature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\nexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his\ntyrannical mandate.",
  "A few days after, the Turk entered his daughters apartment and told\nher hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn\nhad been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the\nFrench government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to\nConstantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He\nintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential\nservant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his\nproperty, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.",
  "When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it\nwould become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey\nwas abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse\nto it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she\nheard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where\nhe then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her\ndetermination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a\nsum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,\nbut who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for\nGermany.",
  "She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage\nof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her\nwith the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the\nArabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country\nand utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however,\ninto good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for\nwhich they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in\nwhich they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at\nthe cottage of her lover.",
  "As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and\ngenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to\nbecome an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities\nwere called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the\nprogress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred\nin the beginning of the month of August of the same year.",
  "One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I\ncollected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on\nthe ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and\nsome books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.\nFortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I\nhad acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume\nof _Plutarchs Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The\npossession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually\nstudied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\nemployed in their ordinary occupations.",
  "I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced\nin me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\nto ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In\nthe _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting\nstory, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon\nwhat had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a\nnever-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and\ndomestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\nfeelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\nwell with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\nwere for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a\nmore divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\ncontained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon\ndeath and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not\npretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards\nthe opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely\nunderstanding it.",
  "As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\ncondition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely\nunlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I\nwas a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I\nwas unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.\nThe path of my departure was free, and there was none to lament my\nannihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did\nthis mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my\ndestination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\nsolve them.",
  "The volume of _Plutarchs Lives_ which I possessed contained the\nhistories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book\nhad a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I\nlearned from Werters imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch\ntaught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my\nown reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many\nthings I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very\nconfused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\nand boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and\nlarge assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the\nonly school in which I had studied human nature, but this book\ndeveloped new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned\nin public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the\ngreatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as\nfar as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they\nwere, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these\nfeelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,\nSolon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The\npatriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\nfirm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had\nbeen made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should\nhave been imbued with different sensations.",
  "But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read\nit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\na true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the\npicture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\nexciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\nstruck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to\nany other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\nin every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a\nperfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\nhis Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from\nbeings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.\nMany times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\noften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter\ngall of envy rose within me.",
  "Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon\nafter my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of\nthe dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had\nneglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in\nwhich they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was\nyour journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You\nminutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\nof your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\noccurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.\nEverything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed\norigin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances\nwhich produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious\nand loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own\nhorrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. Hateful\nday when I received life! I exclaimed in agony. Accursed creator!\nWhy did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in\ndisgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own\nimage; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the\nvery resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire\nand encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.",
  "These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;\nbut when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and\nbenevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should\nbecome acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would\ncompassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn\nfrom their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion\nand friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way\nto fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I\npostponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance\nattached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.\nBesides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every\ndays experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking\nuntil a few more months should have added to my sagacity.",
  "Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The\npresence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also\nfound that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha\nspent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\ntheir labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were\ncontented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while\nmine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only\ndiscovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I\ncherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person\nreflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail\nimage and that inconstant shade.",
  "I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial\nwhich in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\nthoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\ndared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my\nfeelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed\nsmiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my\nsorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adams\nsupplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,\nand in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.",
  "Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay\nand fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it\nhad worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did\nnot heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my\nconformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief\ndelights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay\napparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention\ntowards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the\nabsence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and\ntheir joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the\ncasualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the\ngreater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my\nheart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see\ntheir sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost\nlimit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from\nme with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were\nnever driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a\nlittle food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not\nbelieve myself utterly unworthy of it.",
  "The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\nplace since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely\ndirected towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my\nprotectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally\nfixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.\nI had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my\nperson was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly\nbeheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I\nthought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain\nthe good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means\nbe tolerated by my younger protectors.",
  "One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground\nand diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,\nand Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own\ndesire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,\nhe took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more\nsweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his\ncountenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,\nthoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\ninstrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.",
  "My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which\nwould decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a\nneighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an\nexcellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my\nlimbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting\nall the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had\nplaced before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived\nme, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their\ncottage.",
  "No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an\nunfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation\nor friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never\nseen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail\nthere, I am an outcast in the world for ever.",
  "They are kindthey are the most excellent creatures in the world;\nbut, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good\ndispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree\nbeneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they\nought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable\nmonster.",
  "I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I\nfeel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I\nhave, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily\nkindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and\nit is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.",
  "The old man paused and then continued, If you will unreservedly\nconfide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in\nundeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but\nthere is something in your words which persuades me that you are\nsincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure\nto be in any way serviceable to a human creature.",
  "I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to\nrob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for\nfirmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my\nremaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that\nmoment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment\nto lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, Now is the\ntime! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I\nseek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!",
  "At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and\nAgatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on\nbeholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her\nfriend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with\nsupernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in\na transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently\nwith a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends\nthe antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and\nI refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,\novercome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general\ntumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.",
  "Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I\nnot extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly\nbestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my\nfeelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have\ndestroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with\ntheir shrieks and misery.",
  "When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and\nnow, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my\nanguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken\nthe toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging\nthrough the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable\nnight I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees\nwaved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird\nburst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest\nor in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and\nfinding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread\nhavoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed\nthe ruin.",
  "But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\nfatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in\nthe sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men\nthat existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\ntowards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war\nagainst the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me\nand sent me forth to this insupportable misery.",
  "The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some\ndegree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\ncottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\nconclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that\nmy conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a\nfool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I\nought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to\nhave discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have\nbeen prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be\nirretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the\ncottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my\nparty.",
  "These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\nsleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\npeaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\nacting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\ntearing me from his fathers feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that\nit was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\nsearch of food.",
  "When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the\nwell-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.\nI crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the\naccustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun\nmounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I\ntrembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside\nof the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the\nagony of this suspense.",
  "Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they\nentered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\nunderstand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\nwhich differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix\napproached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\nquitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from\nhis discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.",
  "Do you consider, said his companion to him,\nthat you will be obliged to pay three months rent and to lose\nthe produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and\nI beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your\ndetermination.",
  "It is utterly useless, replied Felix; we can\nnever again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest\ndanger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and\nmy sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason\nwith me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this\nplace.",
  "I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\nutter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken\nthe only link that held me to the world. For the first time the\nfeelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\ncontrol them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\nbent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,\nof the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\nexquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\ntears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had\nspurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\ninjure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As\nnight advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\nand after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,\nI waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\noperations.",
  "As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\nalong like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\nspirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the\ndry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\nmy eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\nnearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\nbrand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\nand bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the\ncottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\nlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.",
  "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I\nresolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\nand despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the\nthought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you\nwere my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness\nthan to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had\nbestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from\nthese the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.\nYou had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards\nthis place I resolved to proceed.",
  "But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a\nsouthwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\nonly guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\nthrough, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\ndid not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although\ntowards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,\nheartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions\nand then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.\nBut on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\ndetermined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from\nany other being that wore the human form.",
  "My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was\nlate in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.\nI travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a\nhuman being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;\nrain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface\nof the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,\nearth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The\nmildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\nand bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\ndeeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow\nfell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents\nnow and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\noften wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me\nno respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\nnot extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived\non the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth\nand the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial\nmanner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.",
  "I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\nsecured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding\nthat my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\nafter the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\ncheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\nthe air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\nappeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of\nthese sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and\nforgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears\nagain bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\nthankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.",
  "I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\nboundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\nof the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.\nHere I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard\nthe sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade\nof a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running\ntowards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from\nsomeone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides\nof the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the\nrapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,\nfrom the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She\nwas senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\nanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\nwho was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On\nseeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,\nhastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I\nhardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,\nwhich he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my\ninjurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.",
  "This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being\nfrom destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable\npain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of\nkindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\nbefore gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by\npain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the\nagony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.",
  "For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\ncure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,\nand I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\nrate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented\nalso by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\ninfliction. My daily vows rose for revengea deep and deadly revenge,\nsuch as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had\nendured.",
  "After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The\nlabours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\ngentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my\ndesolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\nthe enjoyment of pleasure.",
  "It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\nthe fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply\nto you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to\nenjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting\nbehind the stupendous mountains of Jura.",
  "At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\nwhich was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\nrunning into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of\ninfancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this\nlittle creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have\nimbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and\neducate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\nthis peopled earth.",
  "Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him\ntowards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before\nhis eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his\nface and said, Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to\nhurt you; listen to me.",
  "As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\nbreast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite\nof my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I\ngazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her\nlovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was\nfor ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could\nbestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in\nregarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\nexpressive of disgust and affright.",
  "While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\ncommitted the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\nentered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was\nsleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her\nwhose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the\nloveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose\njoy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over\nher and whispered, Awake, fairest, thy lover is nearhe who would\ngive his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\nbeloved, awake!",
  "The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she\nindeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus\nwould she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.\nThe thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within menot I, but\nshe, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever\nrobbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had\nits source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of\nFelix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work\nmischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of\nthe folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.",
  "For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,\nsometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and\nits miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,\nand have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\npassion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have\npromised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man\nwill not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself\nwould not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species\nand have the same defects. This being you must create.",
  "I do refuse it, I replied; and no torture shall ever extort a\nconsent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you\nshall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like\nyourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I\nhave answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.",
  "You are in the wrong, replied the fiend; and instead\nof threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I\nam miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,\nwould tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I\nshould pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you\ncould precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the\nwork of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him\nlive with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would\nbestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.\nBut that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our\nunion. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will\nrevenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and\nchiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear\ninextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor\nfinish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of\nyour birth.",
  "I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do\nnot reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt\nemotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a\nhundredfold; for that one creatures sake I would make peace with the\nwhole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.\nWhat I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of\nanother sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it\nis all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be\nmonsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more\nattached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be\nharmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me\nhappy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I\nexcite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my\nrequest!",
  "I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences\nof my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.\nHis tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature\nof fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion\nof happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of\nfeeling and continued,",
  "If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see\nus again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not\nthat of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;\nacorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will\nbe of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.\nWe shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on\nman and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful\nand human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the\nwantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,\nI now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment\nand persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.",
  "You propose, replied I, to fly from the habitations of\nman, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your\nonly companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,\npersevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and\nyou will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,\nand you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.\nThis may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.",
  "How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by\nmy representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?\nI swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that\nwith the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and\ndwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions\nwill have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly\naway, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.",
  "His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and\nsometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when\nI saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my\nfeelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle\nthese sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I\nhad no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which\nwas yet in my power to bestow.",
  "How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If\nI have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;\nthe love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall\nbecome a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices\nare the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will\nnecessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel\nthe affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of\nexistence and events from which I am now excluded.",
  "I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various\narguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which\nhe had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight\nof all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had\nmanifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my\ncalculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers\nand hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices\nwas a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a\nlong pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and\nmy fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.\nTurning to him, therefore, I said,",
  "I swear, he cried, by the sun, and by the blue sky of\nheaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my\nprayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your\nhome and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with\nunutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall\nappear.",
  "His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of\nthe horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent\ntowards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my\nheart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the\nlittle paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced\nperplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences\nof the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the\nhalfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars\nshone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines\nrose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the\nground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange\nthoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I\nexclaimed, Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock\nme; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as\nnought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.",
  "Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no\nrest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could\ngive no expression to my sensationsthey weighed on me with a\nmountains weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.\nThus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the\nfamily. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I\nanswered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed\nunder a banas if I had no right to claim their sympathiesas if\nnever more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I\nloved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate\nmyself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation\nmade every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,\nand that thought only had to me the reality of life.",
  "Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and\nI could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the\nvengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my\nrepugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not\ncompose a female without again devoting several months to profound\nstudy and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries\nhaving been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was\nmaterial to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my\nfathers consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to\nevery pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an\nundertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to\nme. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had\nhitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when\nunchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My\nfather saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts\ntowards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,\nwhich every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring\nblackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took\nrefuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake\nalone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the\nrippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and\nbright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and\non my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile\nand a more cheerful heart.",
  "I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former\npleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still\nunhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in\nconjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,\nand if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a\npoint would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.",
  "I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your\nmarriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the\nstay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your\nearliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and\ntastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of\nman that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have\nentirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any\nwish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another\nwhom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to\nElizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear\nto feel.",
  "The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,\ngives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you\nfeel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast\na gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so\nstrong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,\ntherefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the\nmarriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us\nfrom that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You\nare younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\nfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future\nplans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,\nhowever, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on\nyour part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words\nwith candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and\nsincerity.",
  "I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable\nof offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of\nthoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me\nthe idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and\ndismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled\nand dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not\nimpend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival\nwith this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the\nground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with\nhis mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from\nwhich I expected peace.",
  "I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to\nEngland or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers\nof that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable\nuse to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining\nthe desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I\nhad an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my\nloathsome task in my fathers house while in habits of familiar\nintercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful\naccidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to\nthrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I\nshould often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the\nharrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my\nunearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus\nemployed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be\nrestored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,\nthe monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some\naccident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my\nslavery for ever.",
  "These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to\nvisit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I\nclothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\nurged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\ncomply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that\nresembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find\nthat I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,\nand he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my\nreturn, have restored me entirely to myself.",
  "The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or\nat most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind\nprecaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without\npreviously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\narranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered\nwith the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\ncommencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be\nan impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many\nhours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between\nme and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times\nforce his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to\ncontemplate its progress?",
  "To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union\nwith Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My fathers\nage rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one\nreward I promised myself from my detested toilsone consolation for my\nunparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,\nenfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and\nforget the past in my union with her.",
  "I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me\nwhich filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should\nleave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and\nunprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\ndeparture. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and\nwould he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in\nitself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\nI was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\nthis might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the\nslave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of\nthe moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\nwould follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his\nmachinations.",
  "It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\ncountry. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth\ntherefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of\nmy suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had\nbeen her care which provided me a companion in Clervaland yet a man\nis blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a womans\nsedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand\nconflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent\nfarewell.",
  "I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\nknowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.\nI remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\nit, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\nme. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful\nand majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could\nonly think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy\nme whilst they endured.",
  "After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed\nmany leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for\nClerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He\nwas alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the\nsetting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new\nday. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and\nthe appearances of the sky. This is what it is to live, he cried;\nnow I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are\nyou desponding and sorrowful! In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\nthoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden\nsunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more\namused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\neye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a\nmiserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to\nenjoyment.",
  "We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to\nRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this\nvoyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.\nWe stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from\nStrasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz\nbecomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds\nbetween hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw\nmany ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\nblack woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,\npresents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view\nrugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with\nthe dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,\nflourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river\nand populous towns occupy the scene.",
  "We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers\nas we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits\ncontinually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the\nbottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\ndrink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these\nwere my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had\nbeen transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by\nman. I have seen, he said, the most beautiful scenes\nof my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the\nsnowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black\nand impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance\nwere it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay\nappearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore\nup whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be\non the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,\nwhere the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and\nwhere their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the\nnightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;\nbut this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The\nmountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a\ncharm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.\nLook at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the\nisland, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\nthat group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\nhalf hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits\nand guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who\npile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of\nour own country.",
  "Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and\nto dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a\nbeing formed in the very poetry of nature. His wild and\nenthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His\nsoul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that\ndevoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only\nin the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to\nsatisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard\nonly with admiration, he loved with ardour:",
  "The sounding cataract\nHaunted him like a passion: the tall rock,\nThe mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\nTheir colours and their forms, were then to him\nAn appetite; a feeling, and a love,\nThat had no need of a remoter charm,\nBy thought supplied, or any interest\nUnborrowd from the eye.",
  "And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost\nfor ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful\nand magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the\nlife of its creator;has this mind perished? Does it now only exist\nin my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and\nbeaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and\nconsoles your unhappy friend.",
  "Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we\narrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.\nIt was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw\nthe white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;\nthey were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the\nremembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish\nArmada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwichplaces which I had heard\nof even in my country.",
  "London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several\nmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the\nintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this\ntime, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally\noccupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the\ncompletion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of\nintroduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most\ndistinguished natural philosophers.",
  "If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\nit would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had\ncome over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of\nthe information they might give me on the subject in which my interest\nwas so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I\ncould fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of\nHenry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory\npeace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to\nmy heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my\nfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and\nJustine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled\nmy soul with anguish.",
  "But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive\nand anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of\nmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of\ninstruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long\nhad in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had\nin his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had\ntaken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\nEuropean colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the\nexecution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\nenjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this\nas much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\nnatural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\nany care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,\nalleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also\nbegan to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this\nwas to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\non the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme\nanguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips\nto quiver, and my heart to palpitate.",
  "After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in\nScotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the\nbeauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient\nallurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,\nwhere he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,\nalthough I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and\nall the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.",
  "We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\nFebruary. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the\nnorth at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not\nintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,\nMatlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of\nthis tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and\nthe materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some\nobscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.",
  "From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds\nwere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\nthere more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles\nI. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,\nafter the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\nParliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his\ncompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\nson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\nmight be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a\ndwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these\nfeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\nthe city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\nThe colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\nmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\nof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\nwhich reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\ndomes, embosomed among aged trees.",
  "I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\nmemory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed\nfor peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never\nvisited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what\nis beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\nthe productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\nelasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\nentered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\nI shall soon cease to bea miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\npitiable to others and intolerable to myself.",
  "We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\nand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\nanimating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery\nwere often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\nthemselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\nfield on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated\nfrom its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\nof liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\nand the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\nand look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\ninto my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\nmiserable self.",
  "We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\nplace of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village\nresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\neverything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\ndistant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\nnative country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\nof natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\nmanner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name\nmade me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\nMatlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.",
  "From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\nCumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the\nSwiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\nnorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\nrocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we\nmade some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\nhappiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\nmine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\nin his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\nimagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\ninferiors. I could pass my life here, said he to me; and among\nthese mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.",
  "But he found that a travellers life is one that includes much pain\namidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\nwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\nthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\nengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.",
  "We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\nand conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\nof our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\nto travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my\npromise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dmons\ndisappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\non my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\nfrom which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited\nfor my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\nmiserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\nsaw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\nread and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend\nfollowed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\nWhen these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\nbut followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\nhis destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\nconsciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed\ndrawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.",
  "I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\nhave interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well\nas Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.\nBut the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic\ncastle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthurs\nSeat, St. Bernards Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for\nthe change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was\nimpatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.",
  "We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrews, and\nalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\nBut I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\ntheir feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\naccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\nalone. Do you, said I, enjoy yourself, and let this be our\nrendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\nmy motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\ntime; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\ncongenial to your own temper.",
  "Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\nremonstrate. He entreated me to write often. I had rather be with\nyou, he said, in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch\npeople, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,\nthat I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in\nyour absence.",
  "With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of\nthe remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place\nfitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were\ncontinually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely\naffording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\ninhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs\ngave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they\nindulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\nthe mainland, which was about five miles distant.",
  "On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\nthese was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two\nrooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\npenury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\ndoor was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\nfurniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\noccasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\nbenumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at\nand unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\nwhich I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\nof men.",
  "In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\nwhen the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to\nlisten to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a\nmonotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was\nfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills\nare covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\nplains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\ntroubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively\ninfant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.",
  "In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but\nas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\nirksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\nlaboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\nin order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in\nwhich I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of\nenthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my\nmind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\nwere shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in\ncold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.",
  "Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in\na solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from\nthe actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I\ngrew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my\npersecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing\nto raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much\ndreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow\ncreatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.",
  "In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably\nadvanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager\nhope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was\nintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken\nin my bosom.",
  "I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just\nrising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I\nremained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my\nlabour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention\nto it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to\nconsider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was\nengaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled\nbarbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest\nremorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was\nalike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her\nmate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had\nsworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she\nhad not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and\nreasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her\ncreation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived\nloathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence\nfor it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn\nwith disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,\nand he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being\ndeserted by one of his own species.",
  "Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,\nyet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dmon\nthirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon\nthe earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a\ncondition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,\nto inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved\nby the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by\nhis fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my\npromise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me\nas their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at\nthe price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.",
  "I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by\nthe light of the moon the dmon at the casement. A ghastly grin\nwrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task\nwhich he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he\nhad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\nand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the\nfulfilment of my promise.",
  "As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\nmalice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my\npromise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,\ntore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me\ndestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\nhappiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.",
  "I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\nheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\nsought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate\nthe gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most\nterrible reveries.",
  "Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;\nit was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature\nreposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone\nspecked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound\nof voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,\nalthough I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear\nwas suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a\nperson landed close to my house.",
  "In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\nendeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\npresentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\ndwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation\nof helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain\nendeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.",
  "You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you\nintend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;\nI left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among\nits willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many\nmonths in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have\nendured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my\nhopes?",
  "Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\nunworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe\nyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of\nday will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;\nobey!",
  "The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is\narrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\nthey confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in\nvice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dmon whose\ndelight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your\nwords will only exasperate my rage.",
  "The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the\nimpotence of anger. Shall each man, cried he, find a\nwife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had\nfeelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.\nMan! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,\nand soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for\never. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my\nwretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge\nremainsrevenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but\nfirst you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your\nmisery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with\nthe wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall\nrepent of the injuries you inflict.",
  "All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to\npursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I\nwalked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\nconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not\nfollowed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him\nto depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered\nto think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.\nAnd then I thought again of his words_I will be with you on\nyour wedding-night._ That, then, was the period fixed for the\nfulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and\nextinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I\nthought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she\nshould find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I\nhad shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall\nbefore my enemy without a bitter struggle.",
  "The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\ncalmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\nthe depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\nnights contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\nalmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\ncreatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I\ndesired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\nbut uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to\nbe sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\ndmon whom I had myself created.",
  "I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\nloved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the\nsun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep\nsleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\nwere agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep\ninto which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\nif I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\nreflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\nwords of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\nlike a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.",
  "The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\nappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\nfishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\nit contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\njoin him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where\nhe was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\nhis return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his\nIndian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as\nhis journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\nconjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\nmy society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to\nleave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\nsouthwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and\nI determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.",
  "Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\nto reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\nmust enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\nhandle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next\nmorning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\nof my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\ndestroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\nmangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and\nthen entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\nout of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\nwork to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\nput them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\nup, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\nmeantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\nchemical apparatus.",
  "Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\nin my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dmon. I had\nbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\nwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\nhad been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\nclearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\nto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\nreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in\nmy own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\nwould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\nbanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\nconclusion.",
  "Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\nbasket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\nThe scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\nbut I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a\ndreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\nfellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\nsuddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\ndarkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\nas it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but\nthe air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\nrising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\nthat I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\ndirect position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the\nmoon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\nkeel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\nslept soundly.",
  "I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\nfound that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and\nthe waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found\nthat the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\nwhich I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\nthat if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\nwater. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\nconfess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me\nand was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\nworld that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the\nwide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\nthe immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already\nbeen out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\nmy other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\nthat flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\nsea; it was to be my grave. Fiend, I exclaimed, your\ntask is already fulfilled! I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\nof Clervalall left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\nsanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so\ndespairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\nclosing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.",
  "Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\nhorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\nfree from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\nand hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\nland towards the south.",
  "How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\nof life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a\npart of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a\nwild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\nthe traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\nsuddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I\ncarefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\nlength saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\nextreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\nwhere I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with\nme. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\nharbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\nescape.",
  "As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\npeople crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my\nappearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\ntogether with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\na slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\nspoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. My\ngood friends, said I, will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\nthis town and inform me where I am?",
  "I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\nstranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\nangry countenances of his companions. Why do you answer me so\nroughly? I replied. Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\nreceive strangers so inhospitably.",
  "While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\nincrease. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\nannoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but\nno one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\ncrowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\napproaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, Come, sir, you must\nfollow me to Mr. Kirwins to give an account of yourself.",
  "This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;\nthat could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\nand was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\nfatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\nto rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\napprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that\nwas in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\nall fear of ignominy or death.",
  "About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\nmagistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\nhis son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten oclock,\nthey observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\nfor port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\nnot land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\ntwo miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\nand his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding\nalong the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\nlength on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the\nlight of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\nwho was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the\ncorpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\nwaves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\nthat the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\nof an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\nto life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\nyears of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\nany violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.",
  "The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\nwhen the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\nmy brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\nmist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\nsupport. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\nan unfavourable augury from my manner.",
  "The son confirmed his fathers account, but when Daniel Nugent was\ncalled he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\nsaw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\nand as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\nboat in which I had just landed.",
  "A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\nof her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\nbefore she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\nonly one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\nwas afterwards found.",
  "Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\nthat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\nwas very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\nobliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\nBesides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\nfrom another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\nthe shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\nof the town of  from the place where I had deposited the corpse.",
  "Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\nthe room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\neffect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably\nsuggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\nmurder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\nand several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the\nstrange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\nknowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\ninhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\ntranquil as to the consequences of the affair.",
  "I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How\ncan I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with\nhorror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\nagony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\npassed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\nClerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\nthe body, I exclaimed, Have my murderous machinations deprived you\nalso, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\nvictims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\nbenefactor",
  "A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\nravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\nmurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\nattendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\ntormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\nmy neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\nmy native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\nbitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.",
  "Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\nsink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\nchildren, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\nyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\nnext a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\nmade that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\nthe wheel, continually renewed the torture?",
  "But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\na dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\ngaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\nIt was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\nforgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\ngreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\nand saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\nwas, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.",
  "This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\nme. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\ncountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\nthat class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\npersons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\ntone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\nand the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.",
  "For that matter, replied the old woman, if you mean about the\ngentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\nwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, thats none\nof my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\nwith a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.",
  "I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\nspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\nlanguid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series\nof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\nwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\nof reality.",
  "As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\nfeverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\nme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The\nphysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\nthem for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\nexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\nsecond. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\nhangman who would gain his fee?",
  "These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\nshown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison\nto be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\nhad provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to\nsee me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\nevery human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\nmiserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see\nthat I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\nintervals.",
  "One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\nhalf open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\nand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\nremain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\nconsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\npenalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\nthoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\nHis countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\nmine and addressed me in French,",
  "I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\none borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I\nhope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\neasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.",
  "Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\nstrange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some\nsurprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\nseized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was\npresented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\nunaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\nyour path.",
  "Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\nyour person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\ntrace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\nand illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\ndiscovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\nto Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\nBut you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\nkind.",
  "I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\ninstantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\nmisery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\nme to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,\nand cried out in agony,",
  "My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\ndwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\ndesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\ncheerfulness. What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!\nsaid he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\nof the room. You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\nto pursue you. And poor Clerval",
  "We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\nprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\ncould ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\nstrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the\nappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\ngradually recovered my health.",
  "As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\nmelancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was\nfor ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation\ninto which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\nrelapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\nlife? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\ndrawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\nthrobbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\nme to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\nsink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\nwish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\nmotionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\nmight bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.",
  "The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months\nin prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\nrelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\ntown where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\ncare of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared\nthe disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\nbrought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand\njury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\nIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\nafter my removal I was liberated from prison.",
  "My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\ncriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\natmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not\nparticipate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\npalace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\nalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\nsaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\nno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes\nthey were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\norbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\nthem; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\nfirst saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.",
  "My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked\nof Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\nthese words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\nwish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\ncousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\nthe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\nchildhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\nprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\nthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\ndespair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\nexistence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\nto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.",
  "Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\ntriumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should\nreturn without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\nI so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\nchance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\nblast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\nthe existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the\nmockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to\ndelay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\njourney, for I was a shattered wreckthe shadow of a human being. My\nstrength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\npreyed upon my wasted frame.",
  "Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\nmy father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel\nbound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\nIt was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\nthe dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\nsight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\nsoon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\nyet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\nshore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\nthat I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\ncompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\nrepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\nwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\nIngolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\nto the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\nwhich he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\nthousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.",
  "Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking\nevery night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug\nonly that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of\nlife. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\nswallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did\nnot afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\nthousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\nof nightmare; I felt the fiends grasp in my neck and could not free\nmyself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\nwatching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\nwere around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\nsecurity, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\nand the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\nforgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly\nsusceptible.",
  "The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon\nfound that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I\ncould continue my journey. My fathers care and attentions were\nindefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and\nsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to\nseek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not\nabhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\nattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an\nangelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right\nto share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose\njoy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they\nwould, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know\nmy unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!",
  "Alas! My father, said I, how little do you know me.\nHuman beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such\na wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent\nas I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause\nof thisI murdered her. William, Justine, and Henrythey all\ndied by my hands.",
  "My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\nassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\nexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of\ndelirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented\nitself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my\nconvalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence\nconcerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be\nsupposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,\nbesides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my\nhearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of\nhis breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was\nsilent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.\nYet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably\nfrom me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part\nrelieved the burden of my mysterious woe.",
  "I am not mad, I cried energetically; the sun and the heavens, who\nhave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the\nassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.\nA thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have\nsaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not\nsacrifice the whole human race.",
  "The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were\nderanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and\nendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as\npossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in\nIreland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my\nmisfortunes.",
  "As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my\nheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own\ncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost\nself-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which\nsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners\nwere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey\nto the sea of ice.",
  "It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\ndated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may\nhope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you\nmust have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than\nwhen you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,\ntortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in\nyour countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of\ncomfort and tranquillity.",
  "Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable\na year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at\nthis period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a\nconversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders\nsome explanation necessary before we meet.",
  "Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If\nyou really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.\nBut you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet\nbe pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the\ncase, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I\nhave often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.",
  "You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of\nyour parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and\ntaught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take\nplace. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I\nbelieve, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But\nas brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each\nother without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our\ncase? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual\nhappiness, with simple truthDo you not love another?",
  "You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at\nIngolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last\nautumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every\ncreature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our\nconnection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of\nyour parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.\nBut this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love\nyou and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant\nfriend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my\nown when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally\nmiserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now\nI weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest\nmisfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that\nlove and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who\nhave so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries\ntenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured\nthat your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be\nmade miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you\nobey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth\nwill have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.",
  "Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the\nnext day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle\nwill send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your\nlips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I\nshall need no other happiness.",
  "This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of\nthe fiend_I will be with you on your\nwedding-night!_ Such was my sentence, and on that night would the\ndmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of\nhappiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he\nhad determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a\ndeadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were\nvictorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he\nwere vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the\npeasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his\ncottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,\npenniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my\nElizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of\nremorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.",
  "Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some\nsoftened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal\ndreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the\nangels arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make\nher happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,\nagain, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My\ndestruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer\nshould suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would\nsurely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed\n_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that\nthreat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that\nhe was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately\nafter the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my\nimmediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my\nfathers happiness, my adversarys designs against my life\nshould not retard it a single hour.",
  "In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and\naffectionate. I fear, my beloved girl, I said, little happiness\nremains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in\nyou. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life\nand my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a\ndreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with\nhorror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only\nwonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of\nmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,\nfor, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But\nuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most\nearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.",
  "In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeths letter we returned\nto Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were\nin her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a\nchange in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly\nvivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of\ncompassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I\nwas.",
  "The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness\nwith it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed\nme; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and\ndespondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,\nbewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.",
  "Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice\nwould soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human\nfeelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason\nreturned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with\nresignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the\nguilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is\notherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.",
  "My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen\nus, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love\nfor those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be\nsmall but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.\nAnd when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of\ncare will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly\ndeprived.",
  "Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the\nthreat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had\nyet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as\ninvincible, and that when he had pronounced the words _I shall be with\nyou on your wedding-night_, I should regard the threatened fate as\nunavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were\nbalanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful\ncountenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the\nceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,\nthe seal to my fate.",
  "Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish\nintention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself\nfor ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over\nthe earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if\npossessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\nintentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I\nhastened that of a far dearer victim.",
  "As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or\na prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my\nfeelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the\ncountenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer\neye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,\nnot unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,\nthat what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate\ninto an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.",
  "Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,\nand all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own\nheart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness\ninto the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the\ndecorations of my tragedy. Through my fathers exertions a part of\nthe inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian\ngovernment. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It\nwas agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa\nLavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake\nnear which it stood.",
  "In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\nfiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger\nconstantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\nby these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the\nperiod approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\nregarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\nin my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed\nfor its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of\nas an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.",
  "Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\ncalm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\ndestiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\nand perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had\npromised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the\nmeantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in\nthe melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.",
  "After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my\nfathers, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\njourney by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our\nvoyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;\nall smiled on our nuptial embarkation.",
  "Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\nfeeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\nwere sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\nbeauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\nMont Salve, the pleasant banks of Montalgre, and at a distance,\nsurmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\nmountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\nopposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\nambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\ninsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.",
  "Be happy, my dear Victor, replied Elizabeth; there is, I hope,\nnothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\npainted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me\nnot to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\nwill not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move\nalong and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\nabove the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\ninteresting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in\nthe clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at\nthe bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature\nappears!",
  "The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and\nobserved its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the\nlower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\nthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The\nspire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range\nof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.",
  "The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\nsank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water\nand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the\nshore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and\nhay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched\nthe shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp\nme and cling to me for ever.",
  "The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence\nin the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was\nbeginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the\nflight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the\nscene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves\nthat were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.",
  "I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the\nshapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious\nand watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in\nmy bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my\nlife dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that\nof my adversary was extinguished.",
  "I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how\nfearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,\nand I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her\nuntil I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.",
  "She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages\nof the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to\nmy adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to\nconjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\nexecution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\nscream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I\nheard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\nmotion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\ntrickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This\nstate lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\ninto the room.",
  "Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the\ndestruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was\nthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down\nand her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I\nturn I see the same figureher bloodless arms and relaxed form flung\nby the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!\nLife is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment\nonly did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.",
  "When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their\ncountenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others\nappeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I\nescaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my\nwife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the\nposture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon\nher arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have\nsupposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but\nthe deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held\nin my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.\nThe murderous mark of the fiends grasp was on her neck, and the\nbreath had ceased to issue from her lips.",
  "While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\nThe windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of\npanic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.\nThe shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\ndescribed, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\nA grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\nfiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards\nthe window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\nleaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\nplunged into the lake.",
  "The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to\nthe spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\nboats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we\nreturned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\nform conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to\nsearch the country, parties going in different directions among the\nwoods and vines.",
  "I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\nhouse, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\nman, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\neyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I\nwas carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\nhappened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\nI had lost.",
  "After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\nwhere the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I\nhung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\ndistinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\nvarious subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\ncause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death\nof William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\nof my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\nfriends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\nmight be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\nfeet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started\nup and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.",
  "There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\nwind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\nhardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\nto row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\nmental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\nand the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\nexertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\nto every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\nfamiliar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\nbefore in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\nTears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\nthe fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\nthen been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\na great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\nbut nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had\nsnatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\nso miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\nman.",
  "But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\noverwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\n_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\nthat, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\nown strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\nmy hideous narration.",
  "I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\nunder the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old\nman! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\ndelighthis Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\nall that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\nfew affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed\nbe the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\nin wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\naround him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to\nrise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.",
  "What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\ndarkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,\nindeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\nwith the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\ndungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\nconception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\nprison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\nunderstood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.",
  "Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\nawakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the\nmemory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\ncausethe monster whom I had created, the miserable dmon whom I had\nsent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a\nmaddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\nthat I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\nrevenge on his cursed head.",
  "Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\nreflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\na month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\nand told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\ndestroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\nauthority for the apprehension of the murderer.",
  "I thank you, replied I; listen, therefore, to the\ndeposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I\nshould fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\nwhich, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\nbe mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood. My\nmanner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\nown heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\nquieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related\nmy history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\naccuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.",
  "When I had concluded my narration, I said, This is the being whom I\naccuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your\nwhole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that\nyour feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those\nfunctions on this occasion.",
  "This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own\nauditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given\nto a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon\nto act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\nreturned. He, however, answered mildly, I would willingly afford you\nevery aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\nhave powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an\nanimal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\nno man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since\nthe commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he\nhas wandered or what region he may now inhabit.",
  "I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\nhe has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\nand destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\ncredit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\npunishment which is his desert.",
  "As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\nYou are mistaken, said he. I will exert myself, and if\nit is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\npunishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\nyourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\nimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\nmake up your mind to disappointment.",
  "That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My\nrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\nconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage\nis unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\nloose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have\nbut one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to\nhis destruction.",
  "I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\nin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness\nwhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan\nmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\ndevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\nmadness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and\nreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.",
  "My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\nswallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\nendowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\nallowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise\ndelirium or death would have been my portion.",
  "And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have\ntraversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships\nwhich travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I\nhave lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon\nthe sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared\nnot die and leave my adversary in being.",
  "When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\nmight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,\nand I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain\nwhat path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the\nentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\nreposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\ngraves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which\nwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the\nscene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\nobserver. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to\ncast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the\nmourner.",
  "The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\nrage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,\nand to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass\nand kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, By the\nsacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the\ndeep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\nspirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dmon who caused this misery,\nuntil he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will\npreserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun\nand tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my\neyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering\nministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed\nand hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now\ntorments me.",
  "I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish\nlaugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed\nit, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.\nSurely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have\ndestroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I\nwas reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known\nand abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an\naudible whisper, I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have\ndetermined to live, and I am satisfied.",
  "I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a\nslight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The\nblue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend\nenter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I\ntook my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.",
  "Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\nhave ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by\nthis horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,\nwho feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\nleft some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw\nthe print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering\non life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\nwhat I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the\nleast pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\nand carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\nfollowed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\nextricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,\nwhen nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\nwas prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The\nfare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\nI will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\ninvoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\nI was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\nfew drops that revived me, and vanish.",
  "I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dmon\ngenerally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\ncountry chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom\nseen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\npath. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\nby distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\nwhich, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\nprovided me with fire and utensils for cooking.",
  "My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\nsleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most\nmiserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\nspirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\nhappiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of\nthis respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\nsustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\nfriends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\ncountenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeths\nvoice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by\na toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\ncome and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\nfriends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to\ntheir dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\npersuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that\nburned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\ndestruction of the dmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\nmechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the\nardent desire of my soul.",
  "What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he\nleft marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided\nme and instigated my fury. My reign is not yet\noverthese words were legible in one of these\ninscriptionsyou live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I\nseek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of\ncold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if\nyou follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my\nenemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable\nhours must you endure until that period shall arrive.",
  "Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,\nmiserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search\nuntil he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my\nElizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the\nreward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!",
  "As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the\ncold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were\nshut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to\nseize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to\nseek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be\nprocured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.",
  "My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\nresolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support\nme, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,\nuntil the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary\nof the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the\nsouth! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by\nits superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when\nthey beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with\nrapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down\nand with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in\nsafety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversarys gibe,\nto meet and grapple with him.",
  "Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus\ntraversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the\nfiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had\ndaily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that\nwhen I first saw the ocean he was but one days journey in advance, and\nI hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new\ncourage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\nhamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the\nfiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,\nhad arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,\nputting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of\nhis terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter\nfood, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\nnumerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same\nnight, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his\njourney across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they\nconjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the\nice or frozen by the eternal frosts.",
  "On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.\nHe had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\njourney across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few\nof the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a\ngenial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea\nthat the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\nreturned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.\nAfter a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\nround and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.",
  "I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured\nmisery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\nburning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and\nrugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard\nthe thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But\nagain the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.",
  "By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that\nI had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction\nof hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of\ndespondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured\nher prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after\nthe poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\nsummit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,\ndied, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\ncaught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to\ndiscover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I\ndistinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known\nform within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\nWarm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\nnot intercept the view I had of the dmon; but still my sight was\ndimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that\noppressed me, I wept aloud.",
  "But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their\ndead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an\nhours rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly\nirksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor\ndid I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short\ntime some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed\nperceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days journey, I\nbeheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within\nme.",
  "But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were\nsuddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had\never done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as\nthe waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous\nand terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;\nand, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a\ntremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few\nminutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left\ndrifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and\nthus preparing for me a hideous death.",
  "In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I\nmyself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your\nvessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.\nI had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded\nat the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and\nby these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in\nthe direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,\nstill to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my\npurpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue\nmy enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my\nvigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied\nhardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.",
  "Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dmon, allow\nme the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,\nswear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him\nand satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to\nundertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?\nNo; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if\nthe ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he\nshall not liveswear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated\nwoes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent\nand persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but\ntrust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery\nand fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,\nJustine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and\nthrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the\nsteel aright.",
  "You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not\nfeel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles\nmine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his\ntale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with\ndifficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes\nwere now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow\nand quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his\ncountenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a\ntranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a\nvolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression\nof the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.",
  "His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,\nyet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,\nand the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a\ngreater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,\nhowever earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!\nI cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I\nendeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his\ncreatures formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.",
  "Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked\nto see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,\nbut principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held\nwith his enemy. Since you have preserved my narration, said\nhe, I would not that a mutilated one should go down to\nposterity.",
  "Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest\ntale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my\nsoul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale\nand his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe\nhim, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of\nevery hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can\nnow know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and\ndeath. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and\ndelirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his\nfriends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or\nexcitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his\nfancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a\nremote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render\nthem to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.",
  "Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and\nmisfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays\nunbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His\neloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates\na pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,\nwithout tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days\nof his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems\nto feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.",
  "When younger, said he, I believed myself destined for\nsome great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness\nof judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of\nthe worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,\nfor I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that\nmight be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had\ncompleted, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational\nanimal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But\nthis thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now\nserves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes\nare as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am\nchained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of\nanalysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I\nconceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot\nrecollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod\nheaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea\nof their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty\nambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once\nwas, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency\nrarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,\nnever, never again to rise.",
  "Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have\nsought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert\nseas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his\nvalue and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.",
  "I thank you, Walton, he said, for your kind intentions towards so\nmiserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh\naffections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any\nman be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even\nwhere the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,\nthe companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our\nminds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our\ninfantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,\nare never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more\ncertain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a\nbrother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,\nsuspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,\nhowever strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be\ncontemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only\nthrough habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever\nI am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of\nClerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one\nfeeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I\nwere engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive\nutility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But\nsuch is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I\ngave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.",
  "I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever\ndoomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit\nit. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and\nthreaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I\nhave persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have\nnone to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our\nsituation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is\nterrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered\nthrough me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.",
  "And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my\ndestruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and\nyou will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My\nbeloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,\nin prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband\nand lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!",
  "My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He\nendeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession\nwhich he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have\nhappened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite\nof myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel\nthe power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he\nrouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these\nvast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the\nresolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of\nexpectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny\ncaused by this despair.",
  "We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger\nof being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of\nmy unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of\ndesolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire\nstill glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly\nroused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent\nlifelessness.",
  "I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.\nThis morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friendhis\neyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlesslyI was roused by half\na dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They\nentered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his\ncompanions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation\nto me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.\nWe were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they\nfeared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free\npassage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and\nlead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted\nthis. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn\npromise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my\ncourse southwards.",
  "This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived\nthe idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in\npossibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when\nFrankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly\nto have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,\nand his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,\nhe said,",
  "What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,\nso easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious\nexpedition? And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was\nsmooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and\nterror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth\nand your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and\nthese you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this\nwas it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the\nbenefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men\nwho encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,\nbehold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first\nmighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content\nto be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and\nperil; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm\nfiresides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come\nthus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove\nyourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your\npurposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your\nhearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it\nshall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace\nmarked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and\nwho know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.",
  "He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed\nin his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can\nyou wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were\nunable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had\nbeen said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously\ndesired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage\nwould return.",
  "It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility\nand glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these\nbitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted\ntowards England and towards you, I will not despond.",
  "September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard\nat a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were\nin the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief\nattention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in\nsuch a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked\nbehind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from\nthe west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly\nfree. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native\ncountry was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,\nloud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the\ncause of the tumult. They shout, I said, because they\nwill soon return to England.",
  "Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but\nmine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but\nsurely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with\nsufficient strength. Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the\nbed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.",
  "It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was\nentirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with\ndifficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing\ndraught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he\ntold me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.",
  "His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat\nby his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but\npresently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,\nsaid, Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall\nsoon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think\nnot, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning\nhatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself\njustified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I\nhave been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.\nIn a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was\nbound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and\nwell-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to\nthat. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to\nmy attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or\nmisery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to\ncreate a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity\nand selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction\nbeings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I\nknow where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may\nrender no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was\nmine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I\nasked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,\nwhen I am only induced by reason and virtue.",
  "Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil\nthis task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have\nlittle chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these\npoints, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I\nleave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near\napproach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I\nmay still be misled by passion.",
  "That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in\nother respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the\nonly happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of\nthe beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,\nWalton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it\nbe only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in\nscience and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been\nblasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.",
  "His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his\neffort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he\nattempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and\nhis eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed\naway from his lips.",
  "Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this\nglorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the\ndepth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and\nfeeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of\ndisappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find\nconsolation.",
  "I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the\nbreeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there\nis a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin\nwhere the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.\nGood night, my sister.",
  "I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\nfriend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to\ndescribegigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its\nproportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long\nlocks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and\napparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my\napproach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung\ntowards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of\nsuch loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and\nendeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.\nI called on him to stay.",
  "That is also my victim! he exclaimed. In his murder my\ncrimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its\nclose! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it\navail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee\nby destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer\nme.",
  "His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to\nme the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his\nenemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I\napproached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his\nface, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I\nattempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster\ncontinued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I\ngathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.",
  "And do you dream? said the dmon. Do you think that I was then\ndead to agony and remorse? He, he continued, pointing to the corpse,\nhe suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the\nten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the\nlingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me\non, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the\ngroans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be\nsusceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice\nand hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without\ntorture such as you cannot even imagine.",
  "After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken\nand overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I\nabhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of\nmy existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for\nhappiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me\nhe sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the\nindulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter\nindignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I\nrecollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I\nknew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the\nslave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not\ndisobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had\ncast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my\ndespair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no\nchoice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly\nchosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable\npassion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!",
  "I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called\nto mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and\npersuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my\nfriend, indignation was rekindled within me. Wretch! I said.\nIt is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you\nhave made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are\nconsumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!\nIf he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would\nhe become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you\nfeel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn\nfrom your power.",
  "Oh, it is not thusnot thus, interrupted the being.\nYet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to\nbe the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.\nNo sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of\nvirtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\noverflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has\nbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\nbitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am\ncontent to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am\nwell satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once\nmy fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once\nI falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would\nlove me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was\nnourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has\ndegraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no\nmalignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the\nfrightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same\ncreature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent\nvisions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the\nfallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\nhad friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.",
  "You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\ncrimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them\nhe could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured\nwasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did\nnot satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still\nI desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no\ninjustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\nhumankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\nfriend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic\nwho sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous\nand immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\nabortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my\nblood boils at the recollection of this injustice.",
  "But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and\nthe helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to\ndeath his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have\ndevoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and\nadmiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\nirremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but\nyour abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the\nhands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\nimagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands\nwill meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.",
  "Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work\nis nearly complete. Neither yours nor any mans death is needed to\nconsummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,\nbut it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this\nsacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me\nthither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall\ncollect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its\nremains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would\ncreate such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the\nagonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet\nunquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no\nmore, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no\nlonger see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,\nfeeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my\nhappiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first\nopened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the\nrustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to\nme, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by\ncrimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in\ndeath?",
  "Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these\neyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive\nand yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better\nsatiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou\ndidst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;\nand if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think\nand feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than\nthat which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to\nthine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my\nwounds until death shall close them for ever.",
  "But soon, he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, I\nshall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning\nmiseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and\nexult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration\nwill fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit\nwill sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.\nFarewell.",
  "Call me Ishmael. Some years agonever mind how long preciselyhaving\nlittle or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me\non shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part\nof the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and\nregulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about\nthe mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever\nI find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and\nbringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever\nmy hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral\nprinciple to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and\nmethodically knocking peoples hats offthen, I account it high time to\nget to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.\nWith a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I\nquietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they\nbut knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,\ncherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.",
  "There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\nwharves as Indian isles by coral reefscommerce surrounds it with her\nsurf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme\ndowntown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and\ncooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of\nland. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.",
  "Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\nHook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What\ndo you see?Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand\nthousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some\nleaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some\nlooking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the\nrigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these\nare all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plastertied to\ncounters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are\nthe green fields gone? What do they here?",
  "But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\nseemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the\nextremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder\nwarehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water\nas they possibly can without falling in. And there they standmiles of\nthemleagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets\nand avenuesnorth, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell\nme, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all\nthose ships attract them thither?",
  "Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take\nalmost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a\ndale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in\nit. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest\nreveriesstand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will\ninfallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.\nShould you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this\nexperiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical\nprofessor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for\never.",
  "But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\nquietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley\nof the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his\ntrees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were\nwithin; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up\nfrom yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands\nwinds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in\ntheir hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and\nthough this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this\nshepherds head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherds eye were\nfixed upon the magic stream before him.

Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon\nsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy\nhim a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian\ntrip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a\nrobust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?\nWhy upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a\nmystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out\nof sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely\nall this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that\nstory of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild\nimage he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that\nsame image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image\nof the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.",
  "Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin\nto grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my\nlungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a\npassenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a\npurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers\nget sea-sickgrow quarrelsomedont sleep of nightsdo not enjoy\nthemselves much, as a general thing;no, I never go as a passenger;\nnor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction\nof such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all\nhonorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind\nwhatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,\nwithout taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.\nAnd as for going as cook,though I confess there is considerable glory\nin that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-boardyet, somehow, I\nnever fancied broiling fowls;though once broiled, judiciously\nbuttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who\nwill speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled\nfowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the\nmummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.",
  "No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\nplumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\nspar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of\nthing is unpleasant enough. It touches ones sense of honor,\nparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the\nVan Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\njust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been\nlording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in\nawe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a\nschoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and\nthe Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off\nin time.",
  "What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom\nand sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,\nI mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel\nGabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and\nrespectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who aint\na slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may\norder me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about, I have the\nsatisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is\none way or other served in much the same wayeither in a physical or\nmetaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is\npassed round, and all hands should rub each others shoulder-blades,\nand be content.",
  "Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\npaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\npenny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must\npay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and\nbeing paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable\ninfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being\npaid_,what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man\nreceives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly\nbelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no\naccount can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign\nourselves to perdition!",
  "Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\nyou never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\nCommodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\nthe sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not\nso. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many\nother things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But\nwherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\nmerchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling\nvoyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the\nconstant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in\nsome unaccountable wayhe can better answer than any one else. And,\ndoubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand\nprogramme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in\nas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive\nperformances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run\nsomething like this:",
  "Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the\nFates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when\nothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short\nand easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farcesthough I\ncannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the\ncircumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives\nwhich being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced\nme to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the\ndelusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill\nand discriminating judgment.",
  "Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale\nhimself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my\ncuriosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island\nbulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all\nthe attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,\nhelped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things\nwould not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an\neverlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and\nland on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to\nperceive a horror, and could still be social with itwould they let\nmesince it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of\nthe place one lodges in.",
  "By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\ngreat flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\nconceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\nmy inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them\nall, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.",
  "I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\narm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city\nof old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night\nin December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little\npacket for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching\nthat place would offer, till the following Monday.",
  "As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at\nthis same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well\nbe related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was\nmade up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a\nfine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous\nold island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has\nof late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though\nin this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket\nwas her great originalthe Tyre of this Carthage;the place where the\nfirst dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket\ndid those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes\nto give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did\nthat first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with\nimported cobblestonesso goes the storyto throw at the whales, in\norder to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\nbowsprit?",
  "Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me\nin New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a\nmatter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a\nvery dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold\nand cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had\nsounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,So,\nwherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of\na dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the\nnorth with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you\nmay conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to\ninquire the price, and dont be too particular.",
  "With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of The\nCrossed Harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further\non, from the bright red windows of the Sword-Fish Inn, there came\nsuch fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and\nice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay\nten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,rather weary for me,\nwhen I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from\nhard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most\nmiserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one\nmoment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of\nthe tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; dont\nyou hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are\nstopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets\nthat took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not\nthe cheeriest inns.",
  "Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,\nand here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At\nthis hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of\nthe town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light\nproceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood\ninvitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the\nuses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble\nover an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying\nparticles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,\nGomorrah? But The Crossed Harpoons, and The Sword-Fish?this, then\nmust needs be the sign of The Trap. However, I picked myself up and\nhearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior\ndoor.",
  "It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black\nfaces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of\nDoom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the\npreachers text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping\nand wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing\nout, Wretched entertainment at the sign of The Trap!",
  "Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\ndocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a\nswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly\nrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\nunderneathThe Spouter Inn:Peter Coffin.",
  "Coffin?Spouter?Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought\nI. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this\nPeter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and\nthe place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated\nlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here\nfrom the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a\npoverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very\nspot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.",
  "It was a queer sort of placea gable-ended old house, one side palsied\nas it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,\nwhere that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than\never it did about poor Pauls tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,\nis a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the\nhob quietly toasting for bed. In judging of that tempestuous wind\ncalled Euroclydon, says an old writerof whose works I possess the\nonly copy extantit maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the\noutside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where\nthe frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only\nglazier. True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my\nmindold black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are\nwindows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didnt\nstop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint\nhere and there. But its too late to make any improvements now. The\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted\noff a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth\nagainst the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with\nhis shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a\ncorn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the\ntempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken\nwrapper(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty\nnight; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their\noriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.",
  "But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up\nto the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra\nthan here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the\nline of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in\norder to keep out this frost?",
  "Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the\ndoor of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be\nmoored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a\nCzar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a\ntemperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.",
  "Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\nlow, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\nthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large\noilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\nunequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent\nstudy and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of\nthe neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\npurpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\nyou almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\nEngland hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint\nof much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\nespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\nentry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however\nwild, might not be altogether unwarranted.",
  "But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\nportentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\npicture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\nnameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive\na nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\nhalf-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to\nit, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\nthat marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,\ndeceptive idea would dart you through.Its the Black Sea in a midnight\ngale.Its the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.Its a\nblasted heath.Its a Hyperborean winter scene.Its the breaking-up of\nthe icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to\nthat one portentous something in the pictures midst. _That_ once found\nout, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint\nresemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?",
  "In fact, the artists design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\nwhom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner\nin a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its\nthree dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,\npurposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of\nimpaling himself upon the three mast-heads.",
  "The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\narray of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with\nglittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\nof human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\nround like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\nmower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal\nand savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,\nhorrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances\nand harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\nthis once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan\nSwain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that\nharpoonso like a corkscrew nowwas flung in Javan seas, and run away\nwith by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The\noriginal iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle\nsojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last\nwas found imbedded in the hump.",
  "Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched waycut\nthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\nfireplaces all roundyou enter the public room. A still duskier place\nis this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled\nplanks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old crafts\ncockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored\nold ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like\ntable covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities\ngathered from this wide worlds remotest nooks. Projecting from the\nfurther angle of the room stands a dark-looking denthe bara rude\nattempt at a right whales head. Be that how it may, there stands the\nvast arched bone of the whales jaw, so wide, a coach might almost\ndrive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old\ndecanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,\nlike another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),\nbustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells\nthe sailors deliriums and death.",
  "Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true\ncylinders withoutwithin, the villanous green goggling glasses\ndeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians\nrudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads goblets. Fill to\n_this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_ a penny more;\nand so on to the full glassthe Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp\ndown for a shilling.",
  "Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about\na table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I\nsought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with\na room, received for answer that his house was fullnot a bed\nunoccupied. But avast, he added, tapping his forehead, you haint no\nobjections to sharing a harpooneers blanket, have ye? I spose you are\ngoin a-whalin, so youd better get used to that sort of thing.",
  "I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\never do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that\nif he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\nharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with\nthe half of any decent mans blanket.",
  "I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\nBattery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\nhis jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\nbetween his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but\nhe didnt make much headway, I thought.",
  "At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\nadjoining room. It was cold as Icelandno fire at allthe landlord said\nhe couldnt afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\nwinding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold\nto our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the\nfare was of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potatoes, but\ndumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a\ngreen box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\nmanner.",
  "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\nopen, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their\nshaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,\nall bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they\nseemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from\ntheir boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,\nthat they made a straight wake for the whales mouththe barwhen the\nwrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out\nbrimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon\nwhich Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never\nmind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,\nor on the weather side of an ice-island.",
  "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\nhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\nown sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\nnoise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the\nsea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\nbut a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I\nwill here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six\nfeet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\nhave seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and\nburnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the\ndeep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem\nto give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a\nSoutherner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of\nthose tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When\nthe revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man\nslipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my\ncomrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his\nshipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with\nthem, they raised a cry of Bulkington! Bulkington! wheres\nBulkington? and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.",
  "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\nrather not sleep with your own brother. I dont know how it is, but\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\nsleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,\nand that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\nmultiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\nsleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\ntwo in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all\nsleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\ncover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.",
  "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\nthought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\nharpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\nthe tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\nBesides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home\nand going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\nmidnighthow could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?",
  "Just as you please; Im sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\nmattress, and its a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knots and\nnotches. But wait a bit, Skrimshander; Ive got a carpenters plane\nthere in the barwait, I say, and Ill make ye snug enough. So saying\nhe procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\nthe bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\nlike an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\nplane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\nnear spraining his wrist, and I told him for heavens sake to quitthe\nbed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\nin the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\nshavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\nthe middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\nbrown study.",
  "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\nshort; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\nnarrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\nthan the planed oneso there was no yoking them. I then placed the\nfirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\nleaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\nsoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from\nunder the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\nespecially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\nthe window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\nthe immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\nnight.",
  "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldnt I steal\na march on himbolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\nwakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\nsecond thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\nmorning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\nstanding in the entry, all ready to knock me down!",
  "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\nspending a sufferable night unless in some other persons bed, I began\nto think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\nagainst this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, Ill wait awhile; he must be\ndropping in before long. Ill have a good look at him then, and perhaps\nwe may become jolly good bedfellows after alltheres no telling.",
  "The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\nmightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. No, he\nanswered, generally hes an early birdairley to bed and airley to\nriseyes, hes the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out\na peddling, you see, and I dont see what on airth keeps him so late,\nunless, may be, he cant sell his head.",
  "Landlord, said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\nsnow-stormlandlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\nanother, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a\nbed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\nbelongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have\nnot yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\nexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\ntowards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion,\nlandlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\ndegree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\nharpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the\nnight with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay\nthat story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\nevidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and Ive no idea of\nsleeping with a madman; and you, sir, _you_ I mean, landlord, _you_,\nsir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render\nyourself liable to a criminal prosecution.",
  "Wall, said the landlord, fetching a long breath, thats a purty long\nsarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be\neasy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin you of has just arrived\nfrom the south seas, where he bought up a lot of balmed New Zealand\nheads (great curios, you know), and hes sold all on em but one, and\nthat one hes trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrows Sunday, and it\nwould not do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is\ngoin to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as\nhe was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for\nall the airth like a string of inions.",
  "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\nthat the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling mebut at the\nsame time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\nSaturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\nbusiness as selling the heads of dead idolators?",
  "He pays reglar, was the rejoinder. But come, its getting dreadful\nlate, you had better be turning flukesits a nice bed; Sal and me\nslept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. Theres plenty of room\nfor two to kick about in that bed; its an almighty big bed that. Why,\nafore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the\nfoot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and\nsomehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.\nArter that, Sal said it wouldnt do. Come along here, Ill give ye a\nglim in a jiffy; and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards\nme, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\nclock in the corner, he exclaimed I vum its Sundayyou wont see that\nharpooneer to-night; hes come to anchor somewherecome along then;\n_do_ come; _wont_ ye come?",
  "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of\nthe most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then\nglanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\ncould see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,\nthe four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a\nwhale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a\nhammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a\nlarge seamans bag, containing the harpooneers wardrobe, no doubt in\nlieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone\nfish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon\nstanding at the head of the bed.",
  "But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\nlight, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\narrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it\nto nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\ntinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\nIndian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as\nyou see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\nthat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\nstreets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to\ntry it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy\nand thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious\nharpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit\nof glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my\nlife. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink\nin the neck.",
  "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\nthe bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\nthe middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a\nlittle more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,\nhalf undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\nthe harpooneers not coming home at all that night, it being so very\nlate, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,\nand then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself\nto the care of heaven.",
  "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\nthere is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\nsleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\npretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard\na heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into\nthe room from under the door.",
  "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\nhead-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\ntill spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\nZealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\nlooking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on\nthe floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted\ncords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was\nall eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time\nwhile employed in unlacing the bags mouth. This accomplished, however,\nhe turned roundwhen, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was\nof a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with\nlarge blackish looking squares. Yes, its just as I thought, hes a\nterrible bedfellow; hes been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here\nhe is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his\nface so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\nsticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\nstains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\nbut soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story\nof a white mana whaleman toowho, falling among the cannibals, had\nbeen tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course\nof his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And\nwhat is it, thought I, after all! Its only his outside; a man can be\nhonest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\ncomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\nindependent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\nnothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot\nsuns tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\nnever been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\nextraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\npassing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\nall. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\nfumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\nseal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in\nthe middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand heada ghastly\nthing enoughand crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\nhata new beaver hatwhen I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.\nThere was no hair on his headnone to speak of at leastnothing but a\nsmall scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now\nlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\nthan ever I bolted a dinner.",
  "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\nit was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\nhead-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\nIgnorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\nconfounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of\nhim as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\nthe dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game\nenough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\nconcerning what seemed inexplicable in him.",
  "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\nhis chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were\ncheckered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all\nover the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years\nWar, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still\nmore, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs\nwere running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that\nhe must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman\nin the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to\nthink of it. A peddler of heads tooperhaps the heads of his own\nbrothers. He might take a fancy to mineheavens! look at that tomahawk!",
  "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\nsomething that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\nthat he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,\nor dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in\nthe pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image\nwith a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days old\nCongo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought\nthat this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\nmanner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened\na good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\nbut a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage\ngoes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,\nsets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the\nandirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,\nso that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine\nor chapel for his Congo idol.",
  "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\nill at ease meantimeto see what was next to follow. First he takes\nabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\nthem carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\ntop and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\na sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\nfire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed\nto be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the\nbiscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\noffer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to\nfancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these\nstrange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from\nthe devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing\nsome pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\nthe most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the\nidol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket\nas carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.",
  "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing\nhim now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\noperations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\nnow or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\nI had so long been bound.",
  "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\nTaking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for\nan instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the\nhandle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment\nthe light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between\nhis teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it\nnow; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.",
  "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\nagainst the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\nbe, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his\nguttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\nmeaning.",
  "Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e! again growled the\ncannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the\nhot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.\nBut thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light\nin hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.",
  "You gettee in, he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\nthrowing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a\ncivil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a\nmoment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\nlooking cannibal. Whats all this fuss I have been making about,\nthought I to myselfthe mans a human being just as I am: he has just\nas much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep\nwith a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.",
  "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequegs arm thrown\nover me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\nthought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\nodd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\ntattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no\ntwo parts of which were of one precise shadeowing I suppose to his\nkeeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\nsleeves irregularly rolled up at various timesthis same arm of his, I\nsay, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork\nquilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I\ncould hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues\ntogether; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I\ncould tell that Queequeg was hugging me.",
  "My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\nchild, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\nwhether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\ncircumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or otherI\nthink it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\nsweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\nwas all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,my\nmother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\nbed, though it was only two oclock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\nthe longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\nthere was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\nthird floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\nand with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.",
  "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\nbefore I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small\nof my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun\nshining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\nstreets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\nand worseat last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\nstockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at\nher feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\nslippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to\nlie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and\nmost conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\nseveral hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than\nI have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.\nAt last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and\nslowly waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsI opened my eyes, and the\nbefore sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt\na shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and\nnothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.\nMy arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,\nsilent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely\nseated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\nfrozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet\never thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid\nspell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided\naway from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it\nall, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in\nconfounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I\noften puzzle myself with it.",
  "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\nsupernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\nthose which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequegs pagan arm\nthrown round me. But at length all the past nights events soberly\nrecurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\nthe comical predicament. For though I tried to move his armunlock his\nbridegroom claspyet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\nas though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\nhimQueequeg!but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my\nneck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\nslight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\nsleeping by the savages side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\npretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\nbroad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! Queequeg!in the name of\ngoodness, Queequeg, wake! At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\nloud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\nhugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\nextracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\nall over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in\nbed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if\nhe did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\nhim. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\nnow, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\nlast, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\nand he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\nthe floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\nif it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\nafterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\nunder the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\ntruth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you\nwill; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\nparticular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\nstaring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\nthe time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\na man like Queequeg you dont see every day, he and his ways were well\nworth unusual regarding.",
  "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\none, by the by, and thenstill minus his trowsershe hunted up his\nboots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\nnext movement was to crush himselfboots in hand, and hat onunder the\nbed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\nwas hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\never heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\nboots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\nstageneither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\nto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\neducation was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\nbeen a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\nhimself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\nhe never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\nhis eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\nbeing much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\nonesprobably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented him\nat the first go off of a bitter cold morning.",
  "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\nstreet being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\ninto the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\nQueequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;\nI begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\nparticularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\ncomplied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\nmorning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\namazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\nchest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\npiece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\nand commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\nhis razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed\ncorner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it\na little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\nwall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.\nThinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogerss best cutlery with a\nvengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came\nto know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how\nexceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.",
  "However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a\ngood thing; the mores the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper\nperson, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be\nbackward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in\nthat way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about\nhim, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.",
  "The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the\nnight previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were\nnearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates,\nand sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and\nharpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky\nbeards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning\ngowns.",
  "You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This\nyoung fellows healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and\nwould seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days\nlanded from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades\nlighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the\ncomplexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\nbleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who\ncould show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints,\nseemed like the Andes western slope, to show forth in one array,\ncontrasting climates, zone by zone.",
  "They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease\nin manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though:\nLedyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch\none; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But\nperhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as\nLedyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in\nthe negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungos\nperformancesthis kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode\nof attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort\nof thing is to be had anywhere.",
  "These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\nafter we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some\ngood stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man\nmaintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked\nembarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the\nslightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seasentire\nstrangers to themand duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here\nthey sat at a social breakfast tableall of the same calling, all of\nkindred tasteslooking round as sheepishly at each other as though they\nhad never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green\nMountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior\nwhalemen!",
  "But as for Queequegwhy, Queequeg sat there among themat the head of\nthe table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I\ncannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have\ncordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him,\nand using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it,\nto the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks\ntowards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and\nevery one knows that in most peoples estimation, to do anything coolly\nis to do it genteelly.",
  "We will not speak of all Queequegs peculiarities here; how he eschewed\ncoffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to\nbeefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew\nlike the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was\nsitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat\non, when I sallied out for a stroll.",
  "In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will\nfrequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign\nparts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners\nwill sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not\nunknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live\nYankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water\nStreet and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only\nsailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street\ncorners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy\nflesh. It makes a stranger stare.",
  "But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,\nand Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft\nwhich unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still\nmore curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town\nscores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain\nand glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;\nfellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and\nsnatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence\nthey came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old.\nLook there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat\nand swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.\nHere comes another with a sou-wester and a bombazine cloak.",
  "No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred oneI mean a\ndownright bumpkin dandya fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his\ntwo acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a\ncountry dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished\nreputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the\ncomical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his\nsea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his\ncanvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those\nstraps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,\nbuttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.",
  "But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,\nand bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a\nqueer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would\nthis day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of\nLabrador. As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten\none, they look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to\nlive in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not\nlike Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run\nwith milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.\nYet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more\npatrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New\nBedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of\na country?",
  "Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty\nmansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave\nhouses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian\noceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the\nbottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?",
  "In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their\ndaughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.\nYou must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,\nthey have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly\nburn their lengths in spermaceti candles.",
  "In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine mapleslong\navenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful\nand bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by\ntheir tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is\nart; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright\nterraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at\ncreations final day.",
  "And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But\nroses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks\nis perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that\nbloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young\ngirls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off\nshore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of\nthe Puritanic sands.",
  "Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this\nspecial errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving\nsleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called\nbearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found\na small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors wives and\nwidows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks\nof the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart\nfrom the other, as if each silent grief were insular and\nincommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these\nsilent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble\ntablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the\npulpit. Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not\npretend to quote:",
  "SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,\nWALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats\ncrews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the\nOff-shore Ground in the PACIFIC, _December_ 31_st_, 1839. THIS MARBLE\nIs here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES.",
  "Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated\nmyself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see\nQueequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a\nwondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage\nwas the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because\nhe was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading\nthose frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of\nthe seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation,\nI knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery,\nand so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not\nthe trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here\nbefore me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of\nthose bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed\nafresh.",
  "Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing\namong flowers can sayhere, _here_ lies my beloved; ye know not the\ndesolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in\nthose black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in\nthose immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden\ninfidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse\nresurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a\ngrave. As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as\nhere.",
  "In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;\nwhy it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no\ntales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is\nthat to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix\nso significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if\nhe but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the\nLife Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what\neternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies\nantique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we\nstill refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are\ndwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all\nthe dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify\na whole city. All these things are not without their meanings.",
  "It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a\nNantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky\nlight of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who\nhad gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But\nsomehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine\nchance for promotion, it seemsaye, a stove boat will make me an\nimmortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whalinga\nspeechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what\nthen? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.\nMethinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true\nsubstance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too\nmuch like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking\nthat thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees\nof my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is\nnot me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat\nand stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.",
  "I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\nrobustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon\nadmitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,\nsufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it\nwas the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he\nwas a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in\nhis youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the\nministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy\nwinter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging\ninto a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his\nwrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing\nbloomthe spring verdure peeping forth even beneath Februarys snow. No\none having previously heard his history, could for the first time\nbehold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were\ncertain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that\nadventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that\nhe carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for\nhis tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot\ncloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of\nthe water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one\nby one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;\nwhen, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.",
  "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\nregular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\nfloor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\narchitect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\nfinished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side\nladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife\nof a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of\nred worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely\nheaded, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,\nconsidering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad\ntaste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both\nhands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple\ncast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still\nreverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if\nascending the main-top of his vessel.",
  "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\nwith swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of\nwood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of\nthe pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,\nthese joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not\nprepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn\nround, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder\nstep by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him\nimpregnable in his little Quebec.",
  "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\nFather Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\nsanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\nmere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober\nreason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.\nCan it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies\nhis spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties\nand connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the\nword, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a\nself-containing strongholda lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial\nwell of water within the walls.",
  "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\nborrowed from the chaplains former sea-farings. Between the marble\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back\nwas adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\nagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\nbreakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there\nfloated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angels\nface; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\nships tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\nthe Victorys plank where Nelson fell. Ah, noble ship, the angel\nseemed to say, beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy\nhelm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling\noffserenest azure is at hand.",
  "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\nhad achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the\nlikeness of a ships bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\nprojecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ships fiddle-headed\nbeak.",
  "What could be more full of meaning?for the pulpit is ever this earths\nforemost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the\nworld. From thence it is the storm of Gods quick wrath is first\ndescried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is\nthe God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.\nYes, the worlds a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;\nand the pulpit is its prow.",
  "Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the\nhowling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned\nover the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon\nthe proper page, said: Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the\nfirst chapter of JonahAnd God had prepared a great fish to swallow up\nJonah.",
  "Shipmates, this book, containing only four chaptersfour yarnsis one\nof the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what\ndepths of the soul does Jonahs deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\nlesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in\nthe fishs belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the\nfloods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the\nwaters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_\nis this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a\ntwo-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to\nme as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\nall, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly\nawakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally\nthe deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the\nsin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the\ncommand of Godnever mind now what that command was, or how\nconveyedwhich he found a hard command. But all the things that God\nwould have us do are hard for us to doremember thatand hence, he\noftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we\nmust disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein\nthe hardness of obeying God consists.",
  "With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men\nwill carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the\nCaptains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks\na ship thats bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto\nunheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no\nother city than the modern Cadiz. Thats the opinion of learned men.\nAnd where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from\nJoppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when\nthe Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern\nJaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,\nthe Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the\nwestward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not\nthen, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?\nMiserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with\nslouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the\nshipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So\ndisordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen\nin those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had\nbeen arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly hes a fugitive! no\nbaggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,no friends accompany him\nto the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he\nfinds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as\nhe steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for\nthe moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the strangers\nevil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and\nconfidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the\nman assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but\nstill serious way, one whispers to the otherJack, hes robbed a\nwidow; or, Joe, do you mark him; hes a bigamist; or, Harry lad, I\nguess hes the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike,\none of the missing murderers from Sodom. Another runs to read the bill\nthats stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is\nmoored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a\nparricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and\nlooks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now\ncrowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah\ntrembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so\nmuch the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that\nitself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the\nsailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him\npass, and he descends into the cabin.",
  "Whos there? cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making\nout his papers for the CustomsWhos there? Oh! how that harmless\nquestion mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.\nBut he rallies. I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon\nsail ye, sir? Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,\nthough the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that\nhollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. We sail with the\nnext coming tide, at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing\nhim. No sooner, sir?Soon enough for any honest man that goes a\npassenger. Ha! Jonah, thats another stab. But he swiftly calls away\nthe Captain from that scent. Ill sail with ye,he says,the passage\nmoney how much is that?Ill pay now. For it is particularly written,\nshipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,\nthat he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail. And taken with\nthe context, this is full of meaning.",
  "Now Jonahs Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects\ncrime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In\nthis world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and\nwithout a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\nfrontiers. So Jonahs Captain prepares to test the length of Jonahs\npurse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;\nand its assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\nbut at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with\ngold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions\nstill molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.\nNot a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his\npassage. Point out my state-room, Sir, says Jonah now, Im\ntravel-weary; I need sleep. Thou lookest like it, says the Captain,\ntheres thy room. Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock\ncontains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain\nlaughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of\nconvicts cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed\nand dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the\nlittle state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is\nclose, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,\nbeneath the ships water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment\nof that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of\nhis bowels wards.",
  "Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\noscillates in Jonahs room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\nall, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity\nwith reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\nitself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it\nhung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his\ntormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful\nfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that\ncontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the\nceiling, and the side, are all awry. Oh! so my conscience hangs in\nme! he groans, straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my\nsoul are all in crookedness!",
  "Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\nreeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the\nRoman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;\nas one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy\nanguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at\nlast amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as\nover the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and\ntheres naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,\nJonahs prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.",
  "And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and\nfrom the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,\nglides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded\nsmugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not\nbear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to\nbreak. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when\nboxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is\nshrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with\ntrampling feet right over Jonahs head; in all this raging tumult,\nJonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,\nfeels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far\nrush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving\nthe seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides\nof the shipa berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast\nasleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead\near, What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise! Startled from his lethargy\nby that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the\ndeck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he\nis sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave\nafter wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs\nroaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet\nafloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the\nsteep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing\nbowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the\ntormented deep.",
  "Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,\nand at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to\nhigh Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this\ngreat tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonahs; that discovered, then\nhow furiously they mob him with their questions. What is thine\noccupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now,\nmy shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask\nhim who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer\nto those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put\nby them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard\nhand of God that is upon him.",
  "I am a Hebrew, he criesand thenI fear the Lord the God of Heaven\nwho hath made the sea and the dry land! Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well\nmightest thou fear the Lord God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to\nmake a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more\nappalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating\nGod for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his\ndeserts,when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him\nforth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest\nwas upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means\nto save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;\nthen, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not\nunreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.",
  "And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;\nwhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea\nis still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water\nbehind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless\ncommotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into\nthe yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory\nteeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed\nunto the Lord out of the fishs belly. But observe his prayer, and\nlearn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and\nwail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is\njust. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with\nthis, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards\nHis holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;\nnot clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing\nto God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance\nof him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah\nbefore you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a\nmodel for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it\nlike Jonah.",
  "While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,\nslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,\nwhen describing Jonahs sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.\nHis deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed\nthe warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from\noff his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his\nsimple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.",
  "Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press\nupon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that\nJonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to\nme, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come\ndown from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit,\nand listen as you listen, while some one of you reads _me_ that other\nand more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to _me_, as a pilot of the\nliving God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true\nthings, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the\nears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should\nraise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God\nby taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never\nreached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed\nhim down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him\nalong into the midst of the seas, where the eddying depths sucked him\nten thousand fathoms down, and the weeds were wrapped about his head,\nand all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond\nthe reach of any plummetout of the belly of hellwhen the whale\ngrounded upon the oceans utmost bones, even then, God heard the\nengulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the\nfish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale\ncame breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the\ndelights of air and earth; and vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;\nwhen the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and\nbeatenhis ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring\nof the oceanJonah did the Almightys bidding. And what was that,\nshipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!",
  "This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of\nthe living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from\nGospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God\nhas brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than\nto appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe\nto him who, in this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would\nnot be true, even though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him\nwho, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is\nhimself a castaway!",
  "He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his\nface to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with\na heavenly enthusiasm,But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of\nevery woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,\nthan the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than\nthe kelson is low? Delight is to hima far, far upward, and inward\ndelightwho against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever\nstands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong\narms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has\ngone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the\ntruth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out\nfrom under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,top-gallant\ndelight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his\nGod, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the\nwaves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake\nfrom this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness\nwill be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final\nbreathO Father!chiefly known to me by Thy rodmortal or immortal,\nhere I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this worlds,\nor mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is\nman that he should live out the lifetime of his God?",
  "Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there\nquite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some\ntime. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the\nstove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that\nlittle negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a\njack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to\nhimself in his heathenish way.",
  "But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going\nto the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap\nbegan counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth\npageas I fanciedstopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and\ngiving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He\nwould then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number\none each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was\nonly by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his\nastonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.",
  "With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and\nhideously marred about the faceat least to my tastehis countenance\nyet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You\ncannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I\nsaw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,\nfiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a\nthousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty\nbearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not\naltogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never\nhad had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved,\nhis forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked\nmore expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to\ndecide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent\none. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washingtons\nhead, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long\nregularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were\nlikewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on\ntop. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.",
  "Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be\nlooking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my\npresence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but\nappeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous\nbook. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night\nprevious, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found\nthrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference\nof his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do\nnot know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their\ncalm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had\nnoticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,\nwith the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever;\nappeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.\nAll this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there\nwas something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand\nmiles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that iswhich was the only\nway he could get therethrown among people as strange to him as though\nhe were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;\npreserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;\nalways equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;\nthough no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But,\nperhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of\nso living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man\ngives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the\ndyspeptic old woman, he must have broken his digester.",
  "As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that\nmild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then\nonly glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering\nround the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the\nstorm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of\nstrange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart\nand maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing\nsavage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a\nnature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland\ndeceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to\nfeel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that\nwould have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus\ndrew me. Ill try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness\nhas proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some\nfriendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At\nfirst he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my\nreferring to his last nights hospitalities, he made out to ask me\nwhether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I\nthought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.",
  "We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to\nhim the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures\nthat were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we\nwent to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to\nbe seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,\nproducing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And\nthen we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it\nregularly passing between us.",
  "If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagans\nbreast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and\nleft us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and\nunbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his\nforehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that\nhenceforth we were married; meaning, in his countrys phrase, that we\nwere bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a\ncountryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too\npremature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage\nthose old rules would not apply.",
  "After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\ntogether. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his\nenormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some\nthirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\nmechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them\ntowards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he\nsilenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets. I let them stay.\nHe then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed\nthe paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed\nanxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I\ndeliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or\notherwise.",
  "I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\nPresbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in\nworshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you\nsuppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and\nearthpagans and all includedcan possibly be jealous of an\ninsignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?to do\nthe will of God_that_ is worship. And what is the will of God?to do\nto my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me_that_ is\nthe will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish\nthat this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular\nPresbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him\nin his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped\nprop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with\nQueequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that\ndone, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences\nand all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.",
  "How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential\ndisclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the\nvery bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often\nlie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our\nhearts honeymoon, lay I and Queequega cosy, loving pair.",
  "We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and\nQueequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs\nover mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free\nand easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what\nlittle nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like\ngetting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.",
  "Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position\nbegan to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves\nsitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the\nhead-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two\nnoses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt\nvery nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;\nindeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the\nroom. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some\nsmall part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world\nthat is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If\nyou flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been\nso a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But\nif, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown\nof your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general\nconsciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For\nthis reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire,\nwhich is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height\nof this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket\nbetween you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there\nyou lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.",
  "We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at\nonce I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether\nby day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always\nkeeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of\nbeing in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright\nexcept his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper\nelement of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey\npart. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and\nself-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the\nunilluminated twelve-oclock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable\nrevulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that\nperhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide\nawake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs\nfrom his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong\nrepugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how\nelastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.\nFor now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me,\neven in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy\nthen. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlords policy of\ninsurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential\ncomfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.\nWith our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the\nTomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue\nhanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.",
  "Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to\nfar distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island;\nand, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He\ngladly complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of\nhis words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar\nwith his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story\nsuch as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.",
  "When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a\ngrass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\nsapling; even then, in Queequegs ambitious soul, lurked a strong\ndesire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\ntwo. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and\non the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\nunconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veinsroyal\nstuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\nnourished in his untutored youth.",
  "A Sag Harbor ship visited his fathers bay, and Queequeg sought a\npassage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of\nseamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his fathers influence\ncould prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled\noff to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when\nshe quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a\nlow tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into\nthe water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with\nits prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and\nwhen the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her\nside; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;\nclimbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the\ndeck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though\nhacked in pieces.",
  "In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\ncutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\nQueequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\nwild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\ntold him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savagethis\nsea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captains cabin. They put him down\namong the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter\ncontent to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained\nno seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of\nenlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottomso he told mehe\nwas actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the\narts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more\nthan that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of\nwhalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both\nmiserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his fathers\nheathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the\nsailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they\nspent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for\nlost. Thought he, its a wicked world in all meridians; Ill die a\npagan.",
  "By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having\na coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he\nbeing very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not\nyet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians,\nhad unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty\npagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,as\nsoon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he\nproposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They\nhad made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a\nsceptre now.",
  "I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\nmovements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon\nthis, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my\nintention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port\nfor an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to\naccompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the\nsame watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my\nevery hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of\nboth worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection\nI now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,\ncould not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was\nwholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted\nwith the sea, as known to merchant seamen.",
  "Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,\nfor a block, I settled my own and comrades bill; using, however, my\ncomrades money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed\namazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between\nme and Queequegespecially as Peter Coffins cock and bull stories\nabout him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person\nwhom I now companied with.",
  "We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\npoor carpet-bag, and Queequegs canvas sack and hammock, away we went\ndown to the Moss, the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the\nwharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so\nmuchfor they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\nstreets,but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\nheeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\nnow and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I\nasked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\nwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\nsubstance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\nhe had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\nassured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\nwith the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and\nmowers, who go into the farmers meadows armed with their own\nscythesthough in no wise obliged to furnish themeven so, Queequeg,\nfor his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.",
  "Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\nthe first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The\nowners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\nheavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\nthingthough in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in\nwhich to manage the barrowQueequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it\nfast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. Why,\nsaid I, Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would\nthink. Didnt the people laugh?",
  "Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\nRokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\nof young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\nthis punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\nmat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\ntouched at Rokovoko, and its commanderfrom all accounts, a very\nstately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captainthis\ncommander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequegs sister, a\npretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\nguests were assembled at the brides bamboo cottage, this Captain\nmarches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over\nagainst the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\nKing, Queequegs father. Grace being said,for those people have their\ngrace as well as wethough Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such\ntimes look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying\nthe ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feastsGrace, I\nsay, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial\nceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and\nconsecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage\ncirculates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the\nceremony, and thinking himselfbeing Captain of a shipas having plain\nprecedence over a mere island King, especially in the Kings own\nhousethe Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the\npunchbowl;taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. Now, said\nQueequeg, what you tink now?Didnt our people laugh?",
  "At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the\nschooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one\nside, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees\nall glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of\ncasks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the\nworld-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while\nfrom others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises\nof fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises\nwere on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only\nbegins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,\nfor ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness\nof all earthly effort.",
  "Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little\nMoss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\nsnortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!how I spurned that turnpike\nearth!that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish\nheels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea\nwhich will permit no records.",
  "At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\nHis dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed\nteeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to\nthe blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.\nSideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a\nwire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.\nSo full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging\nbowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of\nthe passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow\nbeings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything\nmore dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies\nand bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come\nfrom the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these\nyoung saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkins\nhour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught\nhim in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,\nsent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern\nin mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,\nwhile Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe\nand passed it to me for a puff.",
  "But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to\nmind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted\nthe weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to\nside, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor\nfellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all\nhands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,\nseemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in\none ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of\nsnapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable\nof being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing\nthe boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the\nmidst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and\ncrawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured\none end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso,\ncaught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next\njerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was\nrun into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern\nboat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long\nliving arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming\nlike a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by\nturns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I\nlooked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.\nThe greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the\nwater, Queequeg, now took an instants glance around him, and seeming\nto see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes\nmore, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other\ndragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor\nbumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the\ncaptain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a\nbarnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.",
  "Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he\nat all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He\nonly asked for waterfresh watersomething to wipe the brine off; that\ndone, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the\nbulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to\nhimselfIts a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We\ncannibals must help these Christians.",
  "Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of\nthe world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely\nthan the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at ita mere hillock, and elbow of\nsand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than\nyou would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some\ngamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they\ndont grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have\nto send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that\npieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true\ncross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,\nto get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an\noasis, three blades in a days walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand\nshoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,\nbelted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island\nof by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will\nsometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these\nextravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.",
  "Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\nsettled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle\nswooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant\nIndian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child\nborne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the\nsame direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage\nthey discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory\ncasket,the poor little Indians skeleton.",
  "What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should\ntake to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs\nin the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more\nexperienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,\nlaunching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;\nput an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at\nBehrings Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared\neverlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\nflood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea\nMastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that\nhis very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and\nmalicious assaults!",
  "And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from\ntheir ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like\nso many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific,\nand Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America\nadd Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English\noverswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;\ntwo thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketers. For the sea\nis his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a\nright of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges;\narmed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though\nfollowing the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,\nother fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw\ntheir living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone\nresides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to\nit in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.\n_There_ is his home; _there_ lies his business, which a Noahs flood\nwould not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.\nHe lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among\nthe waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years\nhe knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells\nlike another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.\nWith the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to\nsleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight\nof land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his\nvery pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.",
  "It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to\nanchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\nbusiness that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord\nof the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the\nTry Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept\nhotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin\nHosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he\nplainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck\nat the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a\nyellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to\nthe larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a\ncorner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first\nman we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very\nmuch puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg\ninsisted that the yellow warehouseour first point of departuremust be\nleft on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say\nit was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in\nthe dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to\ninquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no\nmistaking.",
  "Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses ears,\nswung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an\nold doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other\nside, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.\nPerhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I\ncould not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort\nof crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,\n_two_ of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. Its ominous, thinks\nI. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;\ntombstones staring at me in the whalemens chapel; and here a gallows!\nand a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out\noblique hints touching Tophet?",
  "I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\nwith yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\nunder a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured\neye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen\nshirt.",
  "And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving\nMrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon\nmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\npostponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little\nroom, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently\nconcluded repast, turned round to us and saidClam or Cod?",
  "But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\nShirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing\nbut the word clam, Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading\nto the kitchen, and bawling out clam for two, disappeared.",
  "However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\napparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder\ncame in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!\nhearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than\nhazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up\ninto little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully\nseasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the\nfrosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing\nfood before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we\ndespatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and\nbethinking me of Mrs. Husseys clam and cod announcement, I thought I\nwould try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered\nthe word cod with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few\nmoments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different\nflavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.",
  "Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its\nname; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for\nbreakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you\nbegan to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area\nbefore the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a\npolished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account\nbooks bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the\nmilk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning\nhappening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermens\nboats, I saw Hoseas brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and\nmarching along the sand with each foot in a cods decapitated head,\nlooking very slip-shod, I assure ye.",
  "Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\nconcerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to\nprecede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded\nhis harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. Why not? said I;\nevery true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut why not? Because\nits dangerous, says she. Ever since young Stiggs coming from that\nunfortnt vyge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with\nonly three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back,\nwith his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to\ntake sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg\n(for she had learned his name), I will just take this here iron, and\nkeep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow\nfor breakfast, men?",
  "In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no\nsmall concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\ndiligently consulting Yojothe name of his black little godand Yojo\nhad told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\neveryway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\nharbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say,\nYojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest\nwholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order\nto do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,\nI, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though\nit had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship\nmyself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.",
  "I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\nconfidence in the excellence of Yojos judgment and surprising forecast\nof things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather\ngood sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in\nall cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.",
  "Now, this plan of Queequegs, or rather Yojos, touching the selection\nof our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little\nrelied upon Queequegs sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to\ncarry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances\nproduced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and\naccordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined\nrushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that\ntrifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up\nwith Yojo in our little bedroomfor it seemed that it was some sort of\nLent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with\nQueequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for,\nthough I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his\nliturgies and XXXIX Articlesleaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his\ntomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of\nshavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged\nsauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three\nships up for three-years voyagesThe Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the\nPequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;\n_Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated\ntribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I\npeered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the\nTit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for\na moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.",
  "You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\nknow;square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\ngalliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\nrare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old\nschool, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed\nlook about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and\ncalms of all four oceans, her old hulls complexion was darkened like a\nFrench grenadiers, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her\nvenerable bows looked bearded. Her mastscut somewhere on the coast of\nJapan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a galeher masts\nstood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her\nancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\nflag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these\nher old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining\nto the wild business that for more than half a century she had\nfollowed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he\ncommanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one\nof the principal owners of the Pequod,this old Peleg, during the term\nof his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and\ninlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\nunmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hakes carved buckler or\nbedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his\nneck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of\ntrophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased\nbones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were\ngarnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the\nsperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews\nand tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,\nbut deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile\nwheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller\nwas in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her\nhereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,\nfelt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching\nits jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things\nare touched with that.",
  "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\nauthority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at\nfirst I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of\ntent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It\nseemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical\nshape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber\nblack bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the\nright-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of\nthese slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at\nthe apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved\nto and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachems head. A\ntriangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the\ninsider commanded a complete view forward.",
  "And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by\nhis aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the\nships work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\ncommand. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all\nover with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\nstout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\nconstructed.",
  "There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of\nthe elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,\nand heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;\nonly there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest\nwrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his\ncontinual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\nwindward;for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed\ntogether. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.",
  "Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that\nleg?Ill take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of\nthe marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose\nnow ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant\nships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?it\nlooks a little suspicious, dont it, eh?Hast not been a pirate, hast\nthou?Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?Dost not think of\nmurdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?",
  "Thou art speaking to Captain Pelegthats who ye are speaking to,\nyoung man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted\nout for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We\nare part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest\nto know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way\nof finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap\neye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one\nleg.",
  "I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at\nthe hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I\ncould, What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know\nthere was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed\nI might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.",
  "Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find\nout by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to\nsee the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just\nstep forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back\nto me and tell me what ye see there.",
  "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\nsurprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\nCaptain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\nshares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\nof old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;\neach owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a\nnail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in\nwhaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state\nstocks bringing in good interest.",
  "Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\nQuaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\nthis day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\npeculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by\nthings altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\nQuakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\nare fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.",
  "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\nScripture namesa singularly common fashion on the islandand in\nchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\nQuaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\nunoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when\nthese things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a\nglobular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and\nseclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and\nbeneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\nuntraditionally and independently; receiving all natures sweet or\nsavage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\nbreast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\nadvantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty languagethat man makes\none in a whole nations censusa mighty pageant creature, formed for\nnoble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically\nregarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems\na half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For\nall men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be\nsure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.\nBut, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another;\nand still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from\nanother phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.",
  "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.\nBut unlike Captain Pelegwho cared not a rush for what are called\nserious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\nveriest of all triflesCaptain Bildad had not only been originally\neducated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but\nall his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely\nisland creatures, round the Hornall that had not moved this native\nborn Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his\nvest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common\nconsistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\nconscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\nhad illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn\nfoe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled\ntuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening\nof his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the\nreminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,\nand very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible\nconclusion that a mans religion is one thing, and this practical world\nquite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little\ncabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a\nbroad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,\nchief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted\nbefore, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from\nactive life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining\ndays to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.",
  "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\nincorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\ntask-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\ncurious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\nupon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,\nsore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,\nhe was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used\nto swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an\ninordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When\nBildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking\nat you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch\nsomethinga hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at\nsomething or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished\nbefore him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian\ncharacter. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no\nsuperfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like\nthe worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.",
  "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\nfollowed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\nwas small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,\nand never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was\nplaced beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was\nbuttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in\nreading from a ponderous volume.",
  "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,\nhis friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said\nnothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,\nand drawing forth the ships articles, placed pen and ink before him,\nand seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time\nto settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for\nthe voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid\nno wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares\nof the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to\nthe degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the\nships company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my\nown lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the\nsea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt\nthat from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th\nlaythat is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,\nwhatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was\nwhat they call a rather _long lay_, yet it was better than nothing; and\nif we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I\nwould wear out on it, not to speak of my three years beef and board,\nfor which I would not have to pay one stiver.",
  "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\nfortuneand so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\nthat never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\nworld is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this\ngrim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the\n275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been\nsurprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a\nbroad-shouldered make.",
  "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\nreceiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\nsomething of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\nhow that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore\nthe other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the\nwhole management of the ships affairs to these two. And I did not know\nbut what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\nshipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\nquite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\nown fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\njack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he\nwas such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\nus, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, _Lay_ not up for\nyourselves treasures upon earth, where moth",
  "_Lay_, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\nseventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\nshall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below, where moth and rust do\ncorrupt. It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that, indeed; and though from\nthe magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\nthe slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\nseventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a\n_teenth_ of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\nseventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\nhundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.",
  "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\nCaptain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\nduty thou owest to the other owners of this shipwidows and orphans,\nmany of themand that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this\nyoung man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\norphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.",
  "Thou Bildad! roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\ncabin. Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\nmatters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be\nheavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape\nHorn.",
  "Captain Peleg, said Bildad steadily, thy conscience may be drawing\nten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I cant tell; but as thou art\nstill an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\nconscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering\ndown to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.",
  "Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\ninsult me. Its an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\nhes bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,\nand start my soul-bolts, but IllIllyes, Ill swallow a live goat\nwith all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,\ndrab-coloured son of a wooden guna straight wake with ye!",
  "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\nresponsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all\nidea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\ncommanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,\nI made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\nwrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\ntransom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\nwithdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\nfor Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\nleft in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a\nlittle as if still nervously agitated. Whew! he whistled at lastthe\nsqualls gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at\nsharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs\nthe grindstone. Thats he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,\nIshmaels thy name, didnt ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,\nfor the three hundredth lay.",
  "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\nCaptain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\nindeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and\nreceive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by\narriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,\nand the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the\ncaptain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he\ndoes not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to\nthe owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to\nhave a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his\nhands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain\nAhab was to be found.",
  "But I dont think thou wilt be able to at present. I dont know\nexactly whats the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\nhouse; a sort of sick, and yet he dont look so. In fact, he aint\nsick; but no, he isnt well either. Any how, young man, he wont always\nsee me, so I dont suppose he will thee. Hes a queer man, Captain\nAhabso some thinkbut a good one. Oh, thoult like him well enough; no\nfear, no fear. Hes a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab;\ndoesnt speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.\nMark ye, be forewarned; Ahabs above the common; Ahabs been in\ncolleges, as well as mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders\nthan the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than\nwhales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our\nisle! Oh! he aint Captain Bildad; no, and he aint Captain Peleg;\n_hes Ahab_, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!",
  "Come hither to mehither, hither, said Peleg, with a significance in\nhis eye that almost startled me. Look ye, lad; never say that on board\nthe Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.\nTwas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died\nwhen he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at\nGayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And,\nperhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn\nthee. Its a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; Ive sailed with him as\nmate years ago; I know what he isa good mannot a pious, good man,\nlike Bildad, but a swearing good mansomething like meonly theres a\ngood deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly;\nand I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind\nfor a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump\nthat brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever\nsince he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, hes been a\nkind of moodydesperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all\npass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young\nman, its better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\none. So good-bye to theeand wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens\nto have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wifenot three voyages\nweddeda sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that\nold man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm\nin Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his\nhumanities!",
  "As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\nincidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\nwild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time,\nI felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I dont know what,\nunless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange\nawe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was\nnot exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did\nnot disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed\nlike mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.\nHowever, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so\nthat for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.",
  "As Queequegs Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all\nday, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I\ncherish the greatest respect towards everybodys religious obligations,\nnever mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue\neven a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other\ncreatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of\nfootmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the\ntorso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the\ninordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.",
  "I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these\nthings, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,\npagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these\nsubjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most\nabsurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;but what of that? Queequeg\nthought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;\nand there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let\nhim be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us allPresbyterians and Pagans\nalikefor we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and\nsadly need mending.",
  "Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and\nrituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;\nbut no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.\nQueequeg, said I softly through the key-hole:all silent. I say,\nQueequeg! why dont you speak? Its IIshmael. But all remained still\nas before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant\ntime; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through\nthe key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the\nkey-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see\npart of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing\nmore. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden\nshaft of Queequegs harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous\nhad taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. Thats strange,\nthought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he\nseldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside\nhere, and no possible mistake.",
  "Queequeg!Queequeg!all still. Something must have happened.\nApoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.\nRunning down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person\nI metthe chamber-maid. La! la! she cried, I thought something must\nbe the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was\nlocked; and not a mouse to be heard; and its been just so silent ever\nsince. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your\nbaggage in for safe keeping. La! la, maam!Mistress! murder! Mrs.\nHussey! apoplexy!and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I\nfollowing.",
  "Wood-house! cried I, which way to it? Run for Gods sake, and fetch\nsomething to pry open the doorthe axe!the axe! hes had a stroke;\ndepend upon it!and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs\nagain empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and\nvinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.",
  "In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand\nthe whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of\nher nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimedNo! I havent\nseen it since I put it there. Running to a little closet under the\nlanding of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that\nQueequegs harpoon was missing. Hes killed himself, she cried. Its\nunfortnate Stiggs done over againthere goes another counterpaneGod\npity his poor mother!it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor lad\na sister? Wheres that girl?there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter,\nand tell him to paint me a sign, withno suicides permitted here, and\nno smoking in the parlor;might as well kill both birds at once. Kill?\nThe Lord be merciful to his ghost! Whats that noise there? You, young\nman, avast there!",
  "I dont allow it; I wont have my premises spoiled. Go for the\nlocksmith, theres one about a mile from here. But avast! putting her\nhand in her side-pocket, heres a key thatll fit, I guess; lets\nsee. And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequegs\nsupplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.",
  "Have to burst it open, said I, and was running down the entry a\nlittle, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing\nI should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a\nsudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.",
  "With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming\nagainst the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good\nheavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right\nin the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on\ntop of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat\nlike a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.",
  "But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt\nlike pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost\nintolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;\nespecially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of\neight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.",
  "Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\nQueequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could\ndofor all my polite arts and blandishmentshe would not move a peg,\nnor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in\nthe slightest way.",
  "I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do\nthey fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;\nyes, its part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; hell\nget up sooner or later, no doubt. It cant last for ever, thank God,\nand his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I dont believe its very\npunctual then.",
  "I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long\nstories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,\nas they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or\nbrig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only);\nafter listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven oclock, I\nwent up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg\nmust certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there\nhe was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began\nto grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to\nbe sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\nholding a piece of wood on his head.",
  "Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\nand no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\nturning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\nit promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his\nordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not\nget into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere\nthought of Queequegnot four feet offsitting there in that uneasy\nposition, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really\nwretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide\nawake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!",
  "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\nday; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\nhad been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of\nsun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but\nwith a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his\nforehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.",
  "Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any persons religion,\nbe it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any\nother person, because that other person dont believe it also. But when\na mans religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment\nto him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to\nlodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and\nargue the point with him.",
  "And just so I now did with Queequeg. Queequeg, said I, get into bed\nnow, and lie and listen to me. I then went on, beginning with the rise\nand progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\nreligions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\nQueequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings\nin cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;\nuseless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene\nand common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such\nan extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly\npained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous\nRamadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in;\nhence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must\nnecessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic\nreligionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In\none word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first\nborn on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated\nthrough the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.",
  "I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\ndyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\nin. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\nfeast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\nwherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two oclock in the\nafternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.",
  "No more, Queequeg, said I, shuddering; that will do; for I knew the\ninferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who\nhad visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,\nwhen a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in\nthe yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were\nplaced in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,\nwith breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,\nwere sent round with the victors compliments to all his friends, just\nas though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.",
  "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\nimpression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow\nseemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\nfrom his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\nthan one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\nfinally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\nreligion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending\nconcern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such\na sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\npiety.",
  "As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg\ncarrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us\nfrom his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,\nand furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that\ncraft, unless they previously produced their papers.",
  "First Congregational Church, cried Bildad, what! that worships in\nDeacon Deuteronomy Colemans meeting-house? and so saying, taking out\nhis spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana\nhandkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the\nwigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at\nQueequeg.",
  "Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. I mean, sir, the same\nancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,\nand Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mothers son and soul of us\nbelong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole\nworshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some\nqueer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in _that_ we all\njoin hands.",
  "Splice, thou meanst _splice_ hands, cried Peleg, drawing nearer.\nYoung man, youd better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast\nhand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomywhy Father\nMapple himself couldnt beat it, and hes reckoned something. Come\naboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog\ntherewhats that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great\nanchor, what a harpoon hes got there! looks like good stuff that; and\nhe handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did\nyou ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a\nfish?",
  "Capain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,\nspose him one whale eye, well, den! and taking sharp aim at it, he\ndarted the iron right over old Bildads broad brim, clean across the\nships decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.",
  "Quick, Bildad, said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\nvicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin\ngangway. Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ships papers. We must\nhave Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye,\nQuohog, well give ye the ninetieth lay, and thats more than ever was\ngiven a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.",
  "But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken\npart in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the\noffered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact\ncounterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so\nthat through Captain Pelegs obstinate mistake touching his\nappellative, it stood something like this:",
  "Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,\nand at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his\nbroad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one\nentitled The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose, placed it in\nQueequegs hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,\nlooked earnestly into his eyes, and said, Son of darkness, I must do\nmy duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for\nthe souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways,\nwhich I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial\nbondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the\nwrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer\nclear of the fiery pit!",
  "Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,\ncried Peleg. Pious harpooneers never make good voyagersit takes the\nshark out of em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty\nsharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out\nof all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never\ncame to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he\nshrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case\nhe got stove and went to Davy Jones.",
  "Peleg! Peleg! said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, thou thyself,\nas I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what\nit is to have the fear of death; how, then, canst thou prate in this\nungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this\nsame Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on\nJapan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, didst\nthou not think of Death and the Judgment then?",
  "Hear him, hear him now, cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and\nthrusting his hands far down into his pockets,hear him, all of ye.\nThink of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death\nand the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an\neverlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over\nus, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to\nthink about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking\nof; and how to save all handshow to rig jury-mastshow to get into the\nnearest port; that was what I was thinking of.",
  "Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where\nwe followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some\nsailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he\nstooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which\notherwise might have been wasted.",
  "Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from\nthe water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the\nabove words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,\nlevelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but\nshabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a\nblack handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all\ndirections flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated\nribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.",
  "Thats true, thats trueyes, both true enough. But you must jump when\nhe gives an order. Step and growl; growl and gothats the word with\nCaptain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off\nCape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;\nnothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar\nin Santa?heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver\ncalabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last\nvoyage, according to the prophecy. Didnt ye hear a word about them\nmatters and something more, eh? No, I dont think ye did; how could ye?\nWho knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But howsever, mayhap, yeve\nheard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of\nthat, I dare say. Oh yes, _that_ every one knows amostI mean they\nknow hes only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.",
  "My friend, said I, what all this gibberish of yours is about, I\ndont know, and I dont much care; for it seems to me that you must be\na little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab,\nof that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all\nabout the loss of his leg.",
  "With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like\nstranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a\nlittle, turned and said:Yeve shipped, have ye? Names down on the\npapers? Well, well, whats signed, is signed; and whats to be, will\nbe; and then again, perhaps it wont be, after all. Anyhow, its all\nfixed and arranged aready; and some sailors or other must go with him,\nI suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity em! Morning to ye,\nshipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; Im sorry I stopped\nye.",
  "Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each\nothers fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was\nnothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone\nperhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and\nlooking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,\nthough at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I\nsaid nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my\ncomrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner\nthat we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us,\nbut with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This\ncircumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,\nshrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments\nand half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain\nAhab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver\ncalabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship\nthe day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the\nvoyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy\nthings.",
  "I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really\ndogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,\nand on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on,\nwithout seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and\nfinally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.",
  "A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.\nNot only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on\nboard, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything\nbetokened that the ships preparations were hurrying to a close.\nCaptain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam\nkeeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing\nand providing at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on\nthe rigging were working till long after night-fall.",
  "On the day following Queequegs signing the articles, word was given at\nall the inns where the ships company were stopping, that their chests\nmust be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the\nvessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,\nresolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they\nalways give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail\nfor several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and\nthere is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod\nwas fully equipped.",
  "Every one knows what a multitude of thingsbeds, sauce-pans, knives and\nforks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are\nindispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,\nwhich necessitates a three-years housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far\nfrom all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And\nthough this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means\nto the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of\nthe whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution\nof the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote\nharbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,\nwhaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and\nespecially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which\nthe success of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare\nspars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but\na spare Captain and duplicate ship.",
  "At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the\nPequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,\nfuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time\nthere was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and\nends of things, both large and small.",
  "Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain\nBildads sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable\nspirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if _she_\ncould help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after\nonce fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a\njar of pickles for the stewards pantry; another time with a bunch of\nquills for the chief mates desk, where he kept his log; a third time\nwith a roll of flannel for the small of some ones rheumatic back.\nNever did any woman better deserve her name, which was CharityAunt\nCharity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this\ncharitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn\nher hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,\nand consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother\nBildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of\nwell-saved dollars.",
  "But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on\nboard, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and\na still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor\nCaptain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him\na long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down\nwent his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a\nwhile Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men\ndown the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and\nthen concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.",
  "During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the\ncraft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and\nwhen he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they\nwould answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected\naboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could\nattend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I\nhad been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly\nin my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so\nlong a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the\nabsolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open\nsea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he\nbe already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up\nhis suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I\nsaid nothing, and tried to think nothing.",
  "Morning to ye! morning to ye! he rejoined, again moving off. Oh! I\nwas going to warn ye againstbut never mind, never mindits all one,\nall in the family too;sharp frost this morning, aint it? Good-bye to\nye. Shant see ye again very soon, I guess; unless its before the\nGrand Jury. And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving\nme, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.",
  "At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound\nquiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the\nhatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward\nto the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a\nlight, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a\ntattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his\nface downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber\nslept upon him.",
  "Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to? said I,\nlooking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the\nwharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I\nwould have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\nmatter, were it not for Elijahs otherwise inexplicable question. But I\nbeat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to\nQueequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to\nestablish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleepers rear,\nas though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,\nsat quietly down there.",
  "Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\nlighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\nover the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning\nhim in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\nland, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,\nchiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening\nsome of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house\ncomfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy\nfellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was\nvery convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs\nwhich are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief\ncalling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself\nunder a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.",
  "He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\nwhich, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed\nhis soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The\nstrong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to\ntell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed\ntroubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and\nrubbed his eyes.",
  "At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ships\nriggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and\nafter the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with\nher last gifta night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her\nbrother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the stewardafter all this, the\ntwo Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to\nthe chief mate, Peleg said:",
  "How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain\nPeleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the\nquarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as\nwell as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign\nof him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But\nthen, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in\ngetting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,\nas that was not at all his proper business, but the pilots; and as he\nwas not yet completely recoveredso they saidtherefore, Captain Ahab\nstayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the\nmerchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a\nconsiderable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the\ncabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,\nbefore they quit the ship for good with the pilot.",
  "Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot\nis the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be\nit known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed\npilots of the porthe being suspected to have got himself made a pilot\nin order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was\nconcerned in, for he never piloted any other craftBildad, I say, might\nnow be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the\napproaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave\nof psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some\nsort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good\nwill. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that\nno profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in\ngetting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice\ncopy of Watts in each seamans berth.",
  "Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\nand swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he\nwould sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I\npaused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of\nthe perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for\na pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in\npious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred\nand seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,\nand turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in\nthe act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my\nfirst kick.",
  "Is that the way they heave in the marchant service? he roared.\nSpring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why dont ye\nspring, I say, all of yespring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red\nwhiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I\nsay, all of ye, and spring your eyes out! And so saying, he moved\nalong the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while\nimperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,\nCaptain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.",
  "At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It\nwas a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into\nnight, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose\nfreezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of\nteeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white\nivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from\nthe bows.",
  "Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They\nwere full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in\nthe boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there\nwas yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and\nmeads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the\nspring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.",
  "It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected\nat this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet;\nvery loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a\nvoyagebeyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his\nhard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate\nsailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to\nencounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to\na thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,poor old Bildad\nlingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the\ncabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and\nlooked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only\nbounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the\nland; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere and\nnowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,\nconvulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,\nfor a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,\nNevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.",
  "As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all\nhis philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern\ncame too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to decknow\na word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.",
  "But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about\nhim,Captain Bildadcome, old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-yard\nthere! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful,\ncareful!come, Bildad, boysay your last. Luck to ye, Starbuckluck to\nye, Mr. Stubbluck to ye, Mr. Flaskgood-bye and good luck to ye\nalland this day three years Ill have a hot supper smoking for ye in\nold Nantucket. Hurrah and away!",
  "God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men, murmured old\nBildad, almost incoherently. I hope yell have fine weather now, so\nthat Captain Ahab may soon be moving among yea pleasant sun is all he\nneeds, and yell have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be\ncareful in the hunt, ye mates. Dont stave the boats needlessly, ye\nharpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.\nwithin the year. Dont forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind\nthat cooper dont waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in\nthe green locker! Dont whale it too much a Lords days, men; but\ndont miss a fair chance either, thats rejecting Heavens good gifts.\nHave an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I\nthought. If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication.\nGood-bye, good-bye! Dont keep that cheese too long down in the hold,\nMr. Starbuck; itll spoil. Be careful with the buttertwenty cents the\npound it was, and mind ye, if",
  "When on that shivering winters night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive\nbows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her\nhelm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon\nthe man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years dangerous\nvoyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another\ntempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest\nthings are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs;\nthis six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only\nsay that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that\nmiserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give\nsuccor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort,\nhearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all thats kind to our\nmortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ships\ndirest jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,\nthough it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and\nthrough. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing,\nfights gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks\nall the lashed seas landlessness again; for refuges sake forlornly\nrushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!",
  "Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally\nintolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid\neffort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the\nwildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the\ntreacherous, slavish shore?",
  "But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,\nindefinite as Godso, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,\nthan be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For\nworm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the\nterrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O\nBulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy\nocean-perishingstraight up, leaps thy apotheosis!",
  "As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;\nand as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among\nlandsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I\nam all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby\ndone to us hunters of whales.",
  "In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish\nthe fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not\naccounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a\nstranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,\nit would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were\nhe presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation\nof the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale\nFishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed\npre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.",
  "Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us\nwhalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a\nbutchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we\nare surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is\ntrue. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been\nall Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And\nas for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye\nshall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally\nunknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm\nwhale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But\neven granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered\nslippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable\ncarrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to\ndrink in all ladies plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much\nenhances the popular conceit of the soldiers profession; let me assure\nye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would\nquickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whales vast tail,\nfanning into eddies the air over his head. For what are the\ncomprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and\nwonders of God!",
  "Why did the Dutch in De Witts time have admirals of their whaling\nfleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit\nout whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some\nscore or two of families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did\nBritain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties\nupwards of 1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of\nAmerica now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world;\nsail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen\nthousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,\nat the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our\nharbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if\nthere be not something puissant in whaling?",
  "I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,\npoint out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty\nyears has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken\nin one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way\nand another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so\ncontinuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may\nwell be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves\npregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to\ncatalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past\nthe whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and\nleast known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes\nwhich had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If\nAmerican and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage\nharbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the\nwhale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted\nbetween them and the savages. They may celebrate as they will the\nheroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I\nsay that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket,\nthat were as great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.\nFor in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish\nsharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,\nbattled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines\nand muskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such a\nflourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the\nlife-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures\nwhich Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted\nunworthy of being set down in the ships common log. Ah, the world! Oh,\nthe world!",
  "Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,\nscarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe\nand the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific\ncoast. It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy\nof the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted,\nit might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated\nthe liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain,\nand the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.",
  "That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was\ngiven to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first\nblunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned\nthose shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched\nthere. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.\nMoreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the\nemigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent\nbiscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.\nThe uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do\ncommercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the\nmissionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive\nmissionaries to their first destinations. If that double-bolted land,\nJapan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom\nthe credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.",
  "_The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?_ Who\nwrote the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who\ncomposed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a\nprince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down\nthe words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And\nwho pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!",
  "_No good blood in their veins?_ They have something better than royal\nblood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;\nafterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of\nNantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and\nharpooneersall kith and kin to noble Benjaminthis day darting the\nbarbed iron from one side of the world to the other.",
  "_No dignity in whaling?_ The dignity of our calling the very heavens\nattest. Cetus is a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your\nhat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I\nknow a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty\nwhales. I account that man more honorable than that great captain of\nantiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.",
  "And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet\nundiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute\nin that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably\nambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a\nman might rather have done than to have left undone; if, at my death,\nmy executors, or more properly my creditors, find any precious MSS. in\nmy desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory\nto whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.",
  "It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even\nmodern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their\nfunctions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called,\nand there may be a castor of state. How they use the salt,\npreciselywho knows? Certain I am, however, that a kings head is\nsolemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be,\nthough, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run\nwell, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here,\nconcerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in\ncommon life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints\nhis hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man\nwho uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a\nquoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he cant amount to\nmuch in his totality.",
  "But the only thing to be considered here, is thiswhat kind of oil is\nused at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar\noil, nor castor oil, nor bears oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.\nWhat then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,\nunpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?",
  "The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a\nQuaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an\nicy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being\nhard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood\nwould not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time\nof general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which\nhis state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those\nsummers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his\nthinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties\nand cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was\nmerely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking;\nquite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and\nclosely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,\nlike a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for\nlong ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow\nor torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was\nwarranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed\nto see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he\nhad calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life\nfor the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame\nchapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there\nwere certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some\ncases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly\nconscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,\nthe wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline\nhim to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some\norganizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than\nfrom ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And\nif at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more\ndid his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,\ntend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,\nand open him still further to those latent influences which, in some\nhonest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often\nevinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. I\nwill have no man in my boat, said Starbuck, who is not afraid of a\nwhale. By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and\nuseful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the\nencountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more\ndangerous comrade than a coward.",
  "Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a\nsentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon\nall mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in\nthis business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits\nof the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly\nwasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after\nsun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted\nin fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical\nocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for\ntheirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.\nWhat doom was his own fathers? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could\nhe find the torn limbs of his brother?",
  "With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\nsuperstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which\ncould, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But\nit was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such\nterrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature\nthat these things should fail in latently engendering an element in\nhim, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its\nconfinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it\nwas that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,\nwhile generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or\nwhales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet\ncannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,\nwhich sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged\nand mighty man.",
  "But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete\nabasement of poor Starbucks fortitude, scarce might I have the heart\nto write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose\nthe fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint\nstock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;\nmen may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble\nand so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any\nignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their\ncostliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so\nfar within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character\nseem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a\nvalor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,\ncompletely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But\nthis august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes,\nbut that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt\nsee it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that\ndemocratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God;\nHimself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all\ndemocracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!",
  "If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall\nhereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic\ngraces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among\nthem all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall\ntouch that workmans arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a\nrainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics\nbear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one\nroyal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou\ngreat democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict,\nBunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly\nhammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old\nCervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who\ndidst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a\nthrone! Thou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest\nThy selectest champions from the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O\nGod!",
  "Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,\naccording to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;\nneither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an\nindifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the\nchase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged\nfor the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his\nwhale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his\ncrew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable\narrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about\nthe snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very\ndeath-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and\noff-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his\nold rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated\nmonster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death\ninto an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no\ntelling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;\nbut, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a\ncomfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a\nsort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,\nabout something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and\nnot sooner.",
  "What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,\nunfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\nworld full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;\nwhat helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that\nthing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black\nlittle pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would\nalmost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his\nnose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready\nloaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever\nhe turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from\nthe other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in\nreadiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his\nlegs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.",
  "I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his\npeculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,\nwhether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless\nmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in\ntime of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated\nhandkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal\ntribulations, Stubbs tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of\ndisinfecting agent.",
  "The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Marthas Vineyard. A\nshort, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,\nwho somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally\nand hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of\nhonor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost\nwas he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic\nbulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of\nany possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,\nthe wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least\nwater-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small\napplication of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This\nignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in\nthe matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a\nthree years voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\nthat length of time. As a carpenters nails are divided into wrought\nnails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask\nwas one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They\ncalled him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could\nbe well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in\nArctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers\ninserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions\nof those battering seas.",
  "Now these three matesStarbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.\nThey it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the\nPequods boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which\nCaptain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the\nwhales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being\narmed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio\nof lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.",
  "And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic\nKnight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,\nwho in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the\nformer one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and\nmoreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy\nand friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set\ndown who the Pequods harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of\nthem belonged.",
  "Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly\npromontory of Marthas Vineyard, where there still exists the last\nremnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the\nneighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring\nharpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of\nGay-Headers. Tashtegos long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,\nand black rounding eyesfor an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but\nAntarctic in their glittering expressionall this sufficiently\nproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud\nwarrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had\nscoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer\nsnuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now\nhunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon\nof the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look\nat the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have\ncredited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and\nhalf-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers\nof the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mates squire.",
  "Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\nnegro-savage, with a lion-like treadan Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended\nfrom his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called\nthem ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to\nthem. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,\nlying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been\nanywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors\nmost frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold\nlife of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what\nmanner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,\nand erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six\nfeet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at\nhim; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to\nbeg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro,\nAhasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a\nchess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequods company, be it\nsaid, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men\nbefore the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans\nborn, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same\nwith the American whale fishery as with the American army and military\nand merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the\nconstruction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say,\nbecause in all these cases the native American liberally provides the\nbrains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No\nsmall number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the\noutward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews\nfrom the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the\nGreenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland\nIslands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage\nhomewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,\nbut Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all\nIslanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not\nacknowledging the common continent of men, but each _Isolato_ living on\na separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel,\nwhat a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from\nall the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying\nOld Ahab in the Pequod to lay the worlds grievances before that bar\nfrom which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Piphe\nnever didoh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim\nPequods forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine;\nprelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck\non high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in\nglory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!",
  "For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was\nseen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the\nwatches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed\nto be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from\nthe cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was\nplain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and\ndictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to\npenetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.",
  "Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly\ngazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague\ndisquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the\nsea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at\ntimes by the ragged Elijahs diabolical incoherences uninvitedly\nrecurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived\nof. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was\nalmost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish\nprophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or\nuneasinessto call it sowhich I felt, yet whenever I came to look\nabout me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such\nemotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,\nwere a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the\ntame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me\nacquainted with, still I ascribed thisand rightly ascribed itto the\nfierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation\nin which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the\naspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was\nmost forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and\ninduce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.\nThree better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own\ndifferent way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of\nthem Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being\nChristmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had\nbiting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the\nsouthward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,\ngradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable\nweather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey\nand gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the\nship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping\nand melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of\nthe forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the\ntaffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;\nCaptain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.",
  "There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\nrecovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when\nthe fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,\nor taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His\nwhole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an\nunalterable mould, like Cellinis cast Perseus. Threading its way out\nfrom among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his\ntawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you\nsaw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that\nperpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a\ngreat tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and\nwithout wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from\ntop to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still\ngreenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or\nwhether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could\ncertainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or\nno allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once\nTashtegos senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,\nsuperstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did\nAhab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the\nfury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this\nwild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman\ninsinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out\nof Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,\nthe old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested\nthis old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no\nwhite sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever\nCaptain Ahab should be tranquilly laid outwhich might hardly come to\npass, so he mutteredthen, whoever should do that last office for the\ndead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.",
  "So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the\nlivid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly\nnoted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the\nbarbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come\nto me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished\nbone of the sperm whales jaw. Aye, he was dismasted off Japan, said\nthe old Gay-Head Indian once; but like his dismasted craft, he shipped\nanother mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of em.",
  "I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of\nthe Pequods quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\nthere was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\nplank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\nholding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\nbeyond the ships ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest\nfortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and\nfearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor\ndid his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest\ngestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not\npainful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not\nonly that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion\nin his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some\nmighty woe.",
  "Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.\nBut after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either\nstanding in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or\nheavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\ngrow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,\nwhen the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry\nbleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it\ncame to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,\nfor all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he\nseemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only\nmaking a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\npreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so\nthat there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite\nAhab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that\nlayer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose\nthe loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.",
  "Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\npleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him\nfrom his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and\nMay, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,\nruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some\nfew green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,\nin the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish\nair. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,\nwhich, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.",
  "Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went\nrolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost\nperpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the\nTropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,\nredundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped\nupflaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights\nseemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\npride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted\nsuns! For sleeping man, twas hard to choose between such winsome days\nand such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning\nweather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward\nworld. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild\nhours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice\nmost forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more\nand more they wrought on Ahabs texture.",
  "Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less\nman has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,\nthe old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the\nnight-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he\nseemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits\nwere more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. It feels\nlike going down into ones tomb,he would mutter to himselffor an\nold captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my\ngrave-dug berth.",
  "So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were\nset, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;\nand when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors\nflung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt\nit to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when\nthis sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the\nsilent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old\nman would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled\nway. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like\nthese, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because\nto his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory\nheel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony\nstep, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of\nsharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;\nand as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from\ntaffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,\nwith a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if\nCaptain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say\nnay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\nsomething indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\ninsertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know\nAhab then.",
  "I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,\nmuttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. Its\nvery queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I dont well know whether to go\nback and strike him, orwhats that?down here on my knees and pray for\nhim? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the\nfirst time I ever _did_ pray. Its queer; very queer; and hes queer\ntoo; aye, take him fore and aft, hes about the queerest old man Stubb\never sailed with. How he flashed at me!his eyes like powder-pans! is\nhe mad? Anyway theres something on his mind, as sure as there must be\nsomething on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either,\nmore than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he dont sleep then.\nDidnt that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always\nfinds the old mans hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the\nsheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and\nthe pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on\nit? A hot old man! I guess hes got what some folks ashore call a\nconscience; its a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they sayworse nor a\ntoothache. Well, well; I dont know what it is, but the Lord keep me\nfrom catching it. Hes full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the\nafter hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; whats\nthat for, I should like to know? Whos made appointments with him in\nthe hold? Aint that queer, now? But theres no telling, its the old\ngameHere goes for a snooze. Damn me, its worth a fellows while to be\nborn into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think\nof it, thats about the first thing babies do, and thats a sort of\nqueer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of em.\nBut thats against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh\ncommandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfthSo here goes again.\nBut hows that? didnt he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times\na donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that!_ He might as\nwell have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he _did_ kick me, and I\ndidnt observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It\nflashed like a bleached bone. What the devils the matter with me? I\ndont stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort\nof turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,\nthoughHow? how? how?but the only ways to stash it; so here goes to\nhammock again; and in the morning, Ill see how this plaguey juggling\nthinks over by daylight.",
  "When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the\nbulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a\nsailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also\nhis pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool\non the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.",
  "In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were\nfabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could\none look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without\nbethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank,\nand a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.",
  "Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth\nin quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. How\nnow, he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, this smoking no\nlonger soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be\ngone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuringaye, and\nignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with\nsuch nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were\nthe strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this\npipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white\nvapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like\nmine. Ill smoke no more",
  "Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old mans\nivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to\nkick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And\nthen, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept\nkicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flaskyou know how\ncurious all dreams arethrough all this rage that I was in, I somehow\nseemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an\ninsult, that kick from Ahab. Why, thinks I, whats the row? Its not\na real leg, only a false leg. And theres a mighty difference between\na living thump and a dead thump. Thats what makes a blow from the\nhand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.\nThe living memberthat makes the living insult, my little man. And\nthinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly\ntoes against that cursed pyramidso confoundedly contradictory was it\nall, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, whats his leg\nnow, but a canea whalebone cane. Yes, thinks I, it was only a\nplayful cudgellingin fact, only a whaleboning that he gave menot a\nbase kick. Besides, thinks I, look at it once; why, the end of itthe\nfoot partwhat a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed\nfarmer kicked me, _theres_ a devilish broad insult. But this insult is\nwhittled down to a point only. But now comes the greatest joke of the\ndream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of\nbadger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the\nshoulders, and slews me round. What are you bout? says he. Slid!\nman, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was\nover the fright. What am I about? says I at last. And what business\nis that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do _you_ want a\nkick? By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned\nround his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he\nhad for a cloutwhat do you think, I saw?why thunder alive, man, his\nstern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on\nsecond thoughts, I guess I wont kick you, old fellow. Wise Stubb,\nsaid he, wise Stubb; and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of\neating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasnt going to\nstop saying over his wise Stubb, wise Stubb, I thought I might as\nwell fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my\nfoot for it, when he roared out, Stop that kicking! Halloa, says I,\nwhats the matter now, old fellow? Look ye here, says he; lets\nargue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didnt he? Yes, he did,\nsays Iright _here_ it was. Very good, says hehe used his ivory\nleg, didnt he? Yes, he did, says I. Well then, says he, wise\nStubb, what have you to complain of? Didnt he kick with right good\nwill? it wasnt a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you\nwere kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. Its\nan honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England\nthe greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and\nmade garter-knights of; but, be _your_ boast, Stubb, that ye were\nkicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; _be_\nkicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back;\nfor you cant help yourself, wise Stubb. Dont you see that pyramid?\nWith that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to\nswim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my\nhammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?",
  "May be; may be. But its made a wise man of me, Flask. Dye see Ahab\nstanding there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing\nyou can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,\nwhatever he says. Halloa! Whats that he shouts? Hark!",
  "What do you think of that now, Flask? aint there a small drop of\nsomething queer about that, eh? A white whaledid ye mark that, man?\nLook yetheres something special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask.\nAhab has that thats bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this way.",
  "Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost\nin its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere\nthe Pequods weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of\nthe leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter\nalmost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the\nmore special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which\nare to follow.",
  "It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,\nthat I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The\nclassification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here\nessayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.",
  "Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,\nthose lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real\nknowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in\nsome small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are\nthe men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at\nlarge or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:The Authors\nof the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner;\nRay; Linnus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;\nMarten; Lacpde; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick\nCuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne;\nthe Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to\nwhat ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above\ncited extracts will show.",
  "Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen\never saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional\nharpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate\nsubject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing\nauthority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great\nsperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy\nmentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper\nupon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of\nthe whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the\nprofound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the\nthen fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to\nthis present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats\nand whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference\nto nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past\ndays, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was\nto them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a\nnew proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,the\nGreenland whale is deposed,the great sperm whale now reigneth!",
  "There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the\nliving sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest\ndegree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beales and Bennetts;\nboth in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both\nexact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to\nbe found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes,\nit is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific\ndescription. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic,\nlives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted\nwhales, his is an unwritten life.",
  "Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular\ncomprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the\npresent, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent\nlaborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I\nhereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete;\nbecause any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very\nreason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical\ndescription of the various species, orin this place at leastto much\nof any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of\na systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.",
  "But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the\nPost-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea\nafter them; to have ones hands among the unspeakable foundations,\nribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I\nthat I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful\ntauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a\ncovenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam\nthrough libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with\nwhales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There\nare some preliminaries to settle.",
  "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\nis in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it\nstill remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of\nNature, A.D. 1776, Linnus declares, I hereby separate the whales from\nthe fish. But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,\nsharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnuss express edict,\nwere still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the\nLeviathan.",
  "The grounds upon which Linnus would fain have banished the whales from\nthe waters, he states as follows: On account of their warm bilocular\nheart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem\nintrantem feminam mammis lactantem, and finally, ex lege natur jure\nmeritoque. I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley\nCoffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and\nthey united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether\ninsufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.",
  "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\nground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\nThis fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\nrespect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnus has given\nyou those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;\nwhereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.",
  "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\nwhale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him.\nHowever contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\nmeditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\nfish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\nstill more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\nnoticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a\nvertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,\nthough it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\nposition.",
  "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\nfrom the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\nwith the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\nhand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\nalien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\nmust be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the\ngrand divisions of the entire whale host.",
  "*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and\nDugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are\nincluded by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish\nare a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers,\nand feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny\ntheir credentials as whales; and have presented them with their\npassports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.",
  "BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER I. (_Sperm Whale_).This whale, among the\nEnglish of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter\nwhale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the\nFrench, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the\nLong Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;\nthe most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in\naspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the\nonly creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is\nobtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged\nupon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically\nconsidered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was\nalmost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil\nwas only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days\nspermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a\ncreature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland\nor Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was\nthat quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable\nof the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was\nexceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment\nand medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you\nnowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of\ntime, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was\nstill retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a\nnotion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation\nmust at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this\nspermaceti was really derived.",
  "BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER II. (_Right Whale_).In one respect this is\nthe most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly\nhunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or\nbaleen; and the oil specially known as whale oil, an inferior article\nin commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by\nall the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black\nWhale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a\ndeal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus\nmultitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in\nthe second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the\nEnglish naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the\nBaleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the\nSwedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been\nhunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale\nwhich the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on\nthe Brazil Banks, on the Nor West Coast, and various other parts of\nthe world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.",
  "Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the\nEnglish and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree\nin all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single\ndeterminate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by\nendless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that\nsome departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate.\nThe right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with\nreference to elucidating the sperm whale.",
  "BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER III. (_Fin-Back_).Under this head I reckon\na monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\nLong-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\nwhose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\nAtlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and\nin his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\nportly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great\nlips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting\nfolds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\nfrom which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin\nis some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder\npart of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\nend. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\nthis isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\nsurface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\nspherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows\nupon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\ncircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and\nwavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\nback. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some\nmen are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly\nrising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his\nstraight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear\nupon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in\nswimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems\nthe banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark\nthat style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the\nFin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic\nspecies denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of\nthese so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several\nvarieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales\nand beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\nwhales and rostrated whales, are the fishermens names for a few sorts.",
  "In connection with this appellative of Whalebone whales, it is of\ngreat importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\nconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is\nin vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded\nupon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that\nthose marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to\nafford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other\ndetached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.\nHow then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose\npeculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,\nwithout any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in\nother and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the\nhumpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.\nThen, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these\nhas baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the\nsame with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,\nthey form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of\nthem detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all\ngeneral methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one\nof the whale-naturalists has split.",
  "But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the\nwhale, in his anatomythere, at least, we shall be able to hit the\nright classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\nGreenland whales anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have\nseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\nGreenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various\nleviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as\navailable to the systematizer as those external ones already\nenumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales\nbodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.\nAnd this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only\none that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.",
  "BOOK I. (_Folio_) CHAPTER IV. (_Hump Back_).This whale is often seen\non the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there,\nand towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or\nyou might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the\npopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the\nsperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very\nvaluable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of\nall the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any\nother of them.",
  "BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER V. (_Razor Back_).Of this whale little is\nknown but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a\nretiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no\ncoward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which\nrises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor\ndoes anybody else.",
  "BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER VI. (_Sulphur Bottom_).Another retiring\ngentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the\nTartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen;\nat least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and\nthen always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is\nnever chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are\ntold of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true\nof ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.",
  "*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.\nBecause, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of\nthe former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them\nin figure, yet the bookbinders Quarto volume in its dimensioned form\ndoes not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume\ndoes.",
  "BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER I. (_Grampus_).Though this fish, whose\nloud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to\nlandsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not\npopularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand\ndistinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised\nhim for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to\ntwenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the\nwaist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil\nis considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some\nfishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the\ngreat sperm whale.",
  "BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER II. (_Black Fish_).I give the popular\nfishermens names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.\nWhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and\nsuggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,\nbecause blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the\nHyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the\ncircumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he\ncarries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\naverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\nall latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin\nin swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more\nprofitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the\nHyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic\nemploymentas some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and\nquite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.\nThough their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you\nupwards of thirty gallons of oil.",
  "BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER III. (_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril\nwhale_.Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose\nfrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The\ncreature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\nfeet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly\nspeaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw\nin a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found\non the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner\nsomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What\nprecise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to\nsay. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and\nbill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for\na rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin\nsaid it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the\nsurface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his\nhorn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these\nsurmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided\nhorn may really be used by the Narwhalehowever that may beit would\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.\nThe Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,\nand the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the\nUnicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From\ncertain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same\nsea-unicorns horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote\nagainst poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.\nIt was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same\nway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.\nOriginally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.\nBlack Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that\nvoyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him\nfrom a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the\nThames; when Sir Martin returned from that voyage, saith Black\nLetter, on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long\nhorn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle\nat Windsor. An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on\nbended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,\npertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.",
  "BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER IV. (_Killer_).Of this whale little is\nprecisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed\nnaturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say\nthat he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savagea sort of\nFeegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and\nhangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.\nThe Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.\nException might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the\nground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on\nsea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.",
  "BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER V. (_Thrasher_).This gentleman is famous\nfor his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He\nmounts the Folio whales back, and as he swims, he works his passage by\nflogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar\nprocess. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both\nare outlaws, even in the lawless seas.",
  "To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may\npossibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five\nfeet should be marshalled among WHALESa word, which, in the popular\nsense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down\nabove as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my\ndefinition of what a whale is_i.e._ a spouting fish, with a horizontal\ntail.",
  "BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER 1. (_Huzza Porpoise_).This is the\ncommon porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own\nbestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something\nmust be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always\nswims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing\nthemselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their\nappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of\nfine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.\nThey are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted\na lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding\nthese vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly\ngamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield\nyou one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid\nextracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among\njewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat\nis good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a\nporpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very\nreadily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him;\nand you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.",
  "BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER II. (_Algerine Porpoise_).A pirate.\nVery savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat\nlarger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make.\nProvoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many\ntimes, but never yet saw him captured.",
  "BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER III. (_Mealy-mouthed Porpoise_).The\nlargest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it\nis known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been\ndesignated, is that of the fishersRight-Whale Porpoise, from the\ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In\nshape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a\nless rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and\ngentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises\nhave), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel\nhue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his\nside fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark\nin a ships hull, called the bright waist, that line streaks him from\nstem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.\nThe white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which\nmakes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a\nmeal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of\nthe common porpoise.",
  "Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the\nPorpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the\nLeviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,\nhalf-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by\nreputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their\nfore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to\nfuture investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If\nany of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then\nhe can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his\nFolio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk\nWhale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the\nCannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale;\nthe Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic,\nDutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists\nof uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I\nomit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them\nfor mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.",
  "Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be\nhere, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have\nkept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus\nunfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the\ncrane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small\nerections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true\nones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever\ncompleting anything. This whole book is but a draughtnay, but the\ndraught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!",
  "The large importance attached to the harpooneers vocation is evinced\nby the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\nand more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the\nperson now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\nofficer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\nusage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In\nthose days, the captains authority was restricted to the navigation\nand general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\ndepartment and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer\nreigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\ntitle of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as\nsenior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captains more\ninferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\nharpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\nin the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the\nboat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling\nground) the command of the ships deck is also his; therefore the grand\npolitical maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart\nfrom the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\nprofessional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\ntheir social equal.",
  "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\nthisthe first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\nmerchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\nso, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\nthe after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in\nthe captains cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with\nit.",
  "Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest\nof all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and\nthe community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high\nor low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their\ncommon luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and\nhard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a\nless rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind\nhow much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some\nprimitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious\nexternals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,\nand in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in\nwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\ngrandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as\nmuch outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the\nshabbiest of pilot-cloth.",
  "And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least\ngiven to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage\nhe ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he\nrequired no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the\nquarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar\ncircumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he\naddressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or _in\nterrorem_, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means\nunobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.",
  "Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind\nthose forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;\nincidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than\nthey were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of\nhis brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested;\nthrough those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an\nirresistible dictatorship. For be a mans intellectual superiority what\nit will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over\nother men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and\nentrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.\nThis it is, that for ever keeps Gods true princes of the Empire from\nthe worlds hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can\ngive, to those men who become famous more through their infinite\ninferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than\nthrough their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.\nSuch large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political\nsuperstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot\nimbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of\nNicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an\nimperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the\ntremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would\ndepict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing,\never forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one\nnow alluded to.",
  "But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket\ngrimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and\nKings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old\nwhale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings\nand housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it\nmust needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and\nfeatured in the unbodied air!",
  "It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale\nloaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord\nand master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking\nan observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on\nthe smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on\nthe upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the\ntidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But\npresently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the\ndeck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, Dinner, Mr.\nStarbuck, disappears into the cabin.",
  "When the last echo of his sultans step has died away, and Starbuck,\nthe first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then\nStarbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,\nand, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of\npleasantness, Dinner, Mr. Stubb, and descends the scuttle. The second\nEmir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the\nmain brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important\nrope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid Dinner,\nMr. Flask, follows after his predecessors.",
  "But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\nseems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\nsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his\nshoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right\nover the Grand Turks head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching\nhis cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so\nfar at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other\nprocessions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into\nthe cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,\nthen, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahabs presence,\nin the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.",
  "It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\nartificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\nsome officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\ndefyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\nvery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that\nsame commanders cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say\ndeprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the\ntable; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this\ndifference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of\nBabylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,\ntherein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he\nwho in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own\nprivate dinner-table of invited guests, that mans unchallenged power\nand dominion of individual influence for the time; that mans royalty\nof state transcends Belshazzars, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.\nWho has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Csar.\nIt is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.\nNow, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a\nship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that\npeculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.",
  "Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion\non the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still\ndeferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be\nserved. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\nthere seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\ntheir intent eyes all fastened upon the old mans knife, as he carved\nthe chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they\nwould have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even\nupon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his\nknife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab\nthereby motioned Starbucks plate towards him, the mate received his\nmeat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little\nstarted if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed\nit noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like\nthe Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor\nprofoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals\nwere somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old\nAhab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief\nit was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold\nbelow. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy\nof this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef;\nhis would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help\nhimself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the\nfirst degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never\nmore would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\nnevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask\nhelped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.\nLeast of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he\nthought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its\nclotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so\nlong a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and\ntherefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!\nwas a butterless man!",
  "Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask\nis the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flasks dinner was badly\njammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;\nand yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb\neven, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small\nappetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask\nmust bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that\nday; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the\ndeck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever\nsince he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he\nhad never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.\nFor what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal\nin him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed\nfrom my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of\nold-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before\nthe mast. Theres the fruits of promotion now; theres the vanity of\nglory: theres the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any\nmere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flasks\nofficial capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\nvengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\nthrough the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\nawful Ahab.",
  "Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\nin the Pequods cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted\norder to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was\nrestored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the\nthree harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary\nlegatees. They made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high and\nmighty cabin.",
  "In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\ninvisible domineerings of the captains table, was the entire care-free\nlicense and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior\nfellows the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid\nof the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed\ntheir food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined\nlike lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading\nwith spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that\nto fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale\nDough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly\nquarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he\ndid not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an\nungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,\nharpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted\nDough-Boys memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head\ninto a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,\nbegan laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was\nnaturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\nbread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital\nnurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,\nand the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,\nDough-Boys whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after\nseeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he\nwould escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and\nfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was\nover.",
  "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\nhis filed teeth to the Indians: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\nthe floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the\nlow carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low\ncabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in\na ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\nnot to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\nsmall mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so\nbroad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage\nfed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through\nhis dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\nbeef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\nmortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eatingan ugly sound enoughso\nmuch so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any\nmarks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\nTashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might\nbe picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery\nhanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor\ndid the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for\ntheir lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner,\nthey would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did\nnot at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget\nthat in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\nguilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy!\nhard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin\nshould he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his\ngreat delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to\nhis credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling\nin them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.",
  "In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\ncaptains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights\nthe ships cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that\nanybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,\nthe mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to\nhave lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it\nwas something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a\nmoment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,\nresiding in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin\nwas no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally\nincluded in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He\nlived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\nMissouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan\nof the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the\nwinter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old\nage, Ahabs soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed\nupon the sullen paws of its gloom!",
  "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\nsimultaneously with the vessels leaving her port; even though she may\nhave fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper\ncruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years voyage she\nis drawing nigh home with anything empty in hersay, an empty vial\neventhen, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her\nskysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether\nrelinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.",
  "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\nvery ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\nhere. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\nEgyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\nFor though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by\ntheir tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,\nor Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great\nstone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the\ndread gale of Gods wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel\nbuilders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a\nnation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general\nbelief among archologists, that the first pyramids were founded for\nastronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar\nstair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with\nprodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were\nwont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the\nlook-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing\nin sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,\nwho built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\nlatter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the\nground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a\ndauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his\nplace by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing\neverything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern\nstanders-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\nand bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\nare still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\ndiscovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of\nthe column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and\nfifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\nwhether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great\nWashington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\nBaltimore, and like one of Hercules pillars, his column marks that\npoint of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral\nNelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\nTrafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\ntoken is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\nsmoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\nNelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to\nbefriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\nhowever it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the\nthick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be\nshunned.",
  "It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\nstanders of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not\nso, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\nhistorian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,\nthat in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly\nlaunched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected\nlofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by\nmeans of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.\nA few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New\nZealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned\nboats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we\nthen to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The\nthree mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen\ntaking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other\nevery two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly\npleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is\ndelightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks,\nstriding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while\nbeneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters\nof the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous\nColossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of\nthe sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship\nindolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you\ninto languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime\nuneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras\nwith startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into\nunnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\nsecurities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what\nyou shall have for dinnerfor all your meals for three years and more\nare snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.",
  "In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years\nvoyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the\nmast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be\ndeplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\nof the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of\nanything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a\ncomfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,\na hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small\nand snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your\nmost usual point of perch is the head of the t gallant-mast, where you\nstand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)\ncalled the t gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the\nbeginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bulls horns. To\nbe sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in\nthe shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest\nwatch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul\nis glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about\nin it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing\n(like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a\nwatch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or\nadditional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of\ndrawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of\nyour watch-coat.",
  "Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\nsouthern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or\npulpits, called _crows-nests_, in which the look-outs of a Greenland\nwhaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In\nthe fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled A Voyage among the\nIcebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\nre-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland; in this\nadmirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a\ncharmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\n_crows-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleets\ngood craft. He called it the _Sleets crows-nest_, in honor of\nhimself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all\nridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children\nafter our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and\npatentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other\napparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleets crows-nest is something\nlike a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is\nfurnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head\nin a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into\nit through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or\nside next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker\nunderneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather\nrack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and\nother nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his\nmast-head in this crows-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a\nrifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask\nand shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or\nvagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\nsuccessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the\nwater, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it\nwas plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does,\nall the little detailed conveniences of his crows-nest; but though he\nso enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very\nscientific account of his experiments in this crows-nest, with a small\ncompass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors\nresulting from what is called the local attraction of all binnacle\nmagnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in\nthe ships planks, and in the Glaciers case, perhaps, to there having\nbeen so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though\nthe Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his\nlearned binnacle deviations, azimuth compass observations, and\napproximate errors, he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was\nnot so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail\nbeing attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little\ncase-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crows nest, within\neasy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and\neven love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it\nvery ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,\nseeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while\nwith mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics\naloft there in that birds nest within three or four perches of the\npole.",
  "But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\nCaptain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\ngreatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\nseductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used\nto lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a\nchat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;\nthen ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the\ntop-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so\nat last mount to my ultimate destination.",
  "Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept\nbut sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how\ncould Ibeing left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering\naltitudehow could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all\nwhale-ships standing orders, Keep your weather eye open, and sing out\nevery time.",
  "And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of\nNantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with\nlean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who\noffers to ship with the Phdon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware\nof such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be\nkilled; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes\nround the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor\nare these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery\nfurnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded\nyoung men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking\nsentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches\nhimself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,\nand in moody phrase ejaculates:",
  "Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young\nphilosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient\ninterest in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost\nto all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would\nrather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young\nPlatonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are\nshort-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have\nleft their opera-glasses at home.",
  "Why, thou monkey, said a harpooneer to one of these lads, weve been\ncruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale\nyet. Whales are scarce as hens teeth whenever thou art up here.\nPerhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in\nthe far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of\nvacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending\ncadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;\ntakes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,\nblue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,\nhalf-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every\ndimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him\nthe embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by\ncontinually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit\nebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;\nlike Cranmers sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of\nevery shore the round globe over.",
  "There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a\ngently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from\nthe inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on\nye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your\nidentity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And\nperhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled\nshriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no\nmore to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!",
  "It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning\nshortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the\ncabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that\nhour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in\nthe garden.",
  "Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old\nrounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over\ndented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did\nyou fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,\nyou would see still stranger foot-printsthe foot-prints of his one\nunsleeping, ever-pacing thought.",
  "But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his\nnervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his\nthought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the\nmain-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought\nturn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely\npossessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of\nevery outer movement.",
  "When the entire ships company were assembled, and with curious and not\nwholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike\nthe weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly\nglancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,\nstarted from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him\nresumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched\nhat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among\nthe men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have\nsummoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.\nBut this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:",
  "While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\nslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\nto heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly\nhumming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\ninarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his\nvitality in him.",
  "Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast\nwith the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the\nother, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: Whosoever of ye raises\nme a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;\nwhosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes\npunctured in his starboard flukelook ye, whosoever of ye raises me\nthat same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!",
  "Corkscrew! cried Ahab, aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted\nand wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole\nshock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the\ngreat annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a\nsplit jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have\nseenMoby DickMoby Dick!",
  "Captain Ahab, said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far\nbeen eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed\nstruck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. Captain\nAhab, I have heard of Moby Dickbut it was not Moby Dick that took off\nthy leg?",
  "Who told thee that? cried Ahab; then pausing, Aye, Starbuck; aye, my\nhearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that\nbrought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye, he shouted\nwith a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;\nAye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor\npegging lubber of me for ever and a day! Then tossing both arms, with\nmeasureless imprecations he shouted out: Aye, aye! and Ill chase him\nround Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom,\nand round perditions flames before I give him up. And this is what ye\nhave shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,\nand over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin\nout. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do\nlook brave.",
  "I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\nAhab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I\ncame here to hunt whales, not my commanders vengeance. How many\nbarrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain\nAhab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.",
  "Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a\nlittle lower layer. If moneys to be the measurer, man, and the\naccountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\ngirdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,\nlet me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here!_",
  "Hark ye yet againthe little lower layer. All visible objects, man,\nare but as pasteboard masks. But in each eventin the living act, the\nundoubted deedthere, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth\nthe mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man\nwill strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach\noutside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is\nthat wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think theres naught beyond.\nBut tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous\nstrength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable\nthing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the\nwhite whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me\nof blasphemy, man; Id strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the\nsun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of\nfair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my\nmaster, man, is even that fair play. Whos over me? Truth hath no\nconfines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends glarings is\na doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted\nthee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that\nthing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small\nindignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder\nTurkish cheeks of spotted tawnliving, breathing pictures painted by\nthe sun. The Pagan leopardsthe unrecking and unworshipping things,\nthat live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!\nThe crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this\nmatter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he\nsnorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one\ntost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. Tis but to\nhelp strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From\nthis one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely\nhe will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a\nwhetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!\nSpeak, but speak!Aye, aye! thy silence, then, _that_ voices thee.\n(_Aside_) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in\nhis lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without\nrebellion.",
  "But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab\ndid not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the\nhold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor\nyet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment\ntheir hearts sank in. For again Starbucks downcast eyes lighted up\nwith the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the\nwinds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as\nbefore. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?\nBut rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so\nmuch predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things\nwithin. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost\nnecessities in our being, these still drive us on.",
  "Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he\nordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him\nnear the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three\nmates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ships\ncompany formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant\nsearchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his,\nas the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their\nleader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but,\nalas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.",
  "Drink and pass! he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the\nnearest seaman. The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short\ndraughtslong swallows, men; tis hot as Satans hoof. So, so; it goes\nround excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\nserpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this\nway it comes. Hand it meheres a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so\nbrimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!",
  "Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and\nye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there\nwith your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some\nsort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men,\nyou will yet see thatHa! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner.\nHand it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wert not\nthou St. Vitus impaway, thou ague!",
  "Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me\ntouch the axis. So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three\nlevel, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,\nsuddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from\nStarbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some\nnameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the\nsame fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own\nmagnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained,\nand mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest\neye of Starbuck fell downright.",
  "In vain! cried Ahab; but, maybe, tis well. For did ye three but\nonce take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, _that_\nhad perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped\nye dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do\nappoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen thereyon three\nmost honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain\nthe task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using\nhis tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension,\n_that_ shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your\nseizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!",
  "Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye\nnot the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers,\nadvance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill! Forthwith,\nslowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon\nsockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.",
  "Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow\nthem, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!\nStarbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon\nit. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the\ndeathful whaleboats bowDeath to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do\nnot hunt Moby Dick to his death! The long, barbed steel goblets were\nlifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the\nspirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled,\nand turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished\npewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his free\nhand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.",
  "Yonder, by ever-brimming goblets rim, the warm waves blush like wine.\nThe gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sunslow dived from noongoes\ndown; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then,\nthe crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it\nbright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but\ndarkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. Tis ironthat\nI knownot gold. Tis split, toothat I feel; the jagged edge galls me\nso, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull,\nmine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!",
  "Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred\nme, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not\nme; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can neer enjoy. Gifted\nwith the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most\nsubtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good\nnightgood night! (_waving his hand, he moves from the window_.)",
  "Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;\nbut my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they\nrevolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all\nstand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the\nmatch itself must needs be wasting! What Ive dared, Ive willed; and\nwhat Ive willed, Ill do! They think me madStarbuck does; but Im\ndemoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness thats only calm to\ncomprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered;\nandAye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my\ndismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. Thats\nmore than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye\ncricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I\nwill not say as schoolboys do to bulliesTake some one of your own\nsize; dont pommel _me!_ No, yeve knocked me down, and I am up again;\nbut _ye_ have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your cotton bags!\nI have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahabs compliments to ye; come\nand see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye\nswerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed\npurpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.\nOver unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under\ntorrents beds, unerringly I rush! Naughts an obstacle, naughts an\nangle to the iron way!",
  "My soul is more than matched; shes overmanned; and by a madman!\nInsufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But\nhe drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I\nsee his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill\nI, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have\nno knife to cut. Horrible old man! Whos over him, he cries;aye, he\nwould be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below!\nOh! I plainly see my miserable office,to obey, rebelling; and worse\nyet, to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe\nwould shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow\nwide. The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the\nsmall gold-fish has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God\nmay wedge aside. I would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole\nclocks run down; my heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to\nlift again.",
  "Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of\nhuman mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white\nwhale is their demigorgon.

With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous\nmonster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of\nviolence and revenge.",
  "For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,\nsecluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly\nfrequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of\nhis existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen\nhim; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given\nbattle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of\nwhale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire\nwatery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest\nalong solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth\nor more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any\nsort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity\nof the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances,\ndirect and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole\nworld-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings\nconcerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels\nreported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or\nsuch a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,\nwhich whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had\ncompletely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair\npresumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other\nthan Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked\nby various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and\nmalice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by\naccident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps,\nfor the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,\nmore, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large,\nthan to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous\nencounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly\nregarded.",
  "And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance\ncaught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one\nof them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any\nother whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue\nin these assaultsnot restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken\nlimbs, or devouring amputationsbut fatal to the last degree of\nfatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and\npiling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake\nthe fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White\nWhale had eventually come.",
  "Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more\nhorrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do\nfabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising\nterrible events,as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in\nmaritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors\nabound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.\nAnd as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery\nsurpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and\nfearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only\nare whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and\nsuperstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they\nare by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is\nappallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its\ngreatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such\nremotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a\nthousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or\naught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and\nlongitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is\nwrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many\na mighty birth.",
  "No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over\nthe widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in\nthe end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and\nhalf-formed ftal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which\neventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything\nthat visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally\nstrike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White\nWhale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his\njaw.",
  "But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.\nNot even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm\nWhale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\nleviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are\nthose this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous\nenough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would\nperhapseither from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\ntimidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there\nare plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\nsailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered\nthe Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is\nrestricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;\nseated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish\nfireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern\nwhaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale\nanywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows\nwhich stem him.",
  "And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\ntimes thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\nnaturalistsOlassen and Povelsondeclaring the Sperm Whale not only to\nbe a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be\nso incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.\nNor even down to so late a time as Cuviers, were these or almost\nsimilar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron\nhimself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks\nincluded) are struck with the most lively terrors, and often in the\nprecipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with\nsuch violence as to cause instantaneous death. And however the general\nexperiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in\ntheir full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the\nsuperstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their\nvocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.",
  "So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few\nof the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days\nof the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long\npractised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring\nwarfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be\nhopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition\nas the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be\ninevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are\nsome remarkable documents that may be consulted.",
  "Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\nwere ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,\nchancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\nspecific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\naccompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if\noffered.",
  "One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\nwith the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was\nthe unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had\nactually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same\ninstant of time.",
  "Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\naltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as\nthe secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged,\neven to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm\nWhale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to\nhis pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious\nand contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning\nthe mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he\ntransports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant\npoints.",
  "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and\nas well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,\nthat some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\nbodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland\nseas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has\nbeen declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could\nnot have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been\nbelieved by some whalemen, that the Nor West Passage, so long a\nproblem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the\nreal living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old\ntimes of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there\nwas said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the\nsurface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain\nnear Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy\nLand by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost\nfully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.",
  "Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\nknowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\nescaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen\nshould go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not\nonly ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in\ntime); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he\nwould still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to\nspout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for\nagain in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied\njet would once more be seen.",
  "But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in\nthe earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike\nthe imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his\nuncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,\nbut, as was elsewhere thrown outa peculiar snow-white wrinkled\nforehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent\nfeatures; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he\nrevealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.",
  "The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the\nsame shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\nappellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by\nhis vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue\nsea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\ngleamings.",
  "Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his\ndeformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural\nterror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\nspecific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.\nMore than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than\nperhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,\nwith every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known\nto turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their\nboats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.",
  "Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\ndisasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in\nthe fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whales\ninfernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death\nthat he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an\nunintelligent agent.",
  "Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of\nhis more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed\nboats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the\nwhite curds of the whales direful wrath into the serene, exasperating\nsunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.",
  "His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the\neddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had\ndashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly\nseeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the\nwhale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping\nhis sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away\nAhabs leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk,\nno hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming\nmalice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that\nalmost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness\nagainst the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness\nhe at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but\nall his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam\nbefore him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious\nagencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left\nliving on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity\nwhich has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern\nChristians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of\nthe east reverenced in their statue devil;Ahab did not fall down and\nworship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the\nabhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All\nthat most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;\nall truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\nbrain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy\nAhab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby\nDick. He piled upon the whales white hump the sum of all the general\nrage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if\nhis chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot hearts shell upon it.",
  "It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at\nthe precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the\nmonster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,\ncorporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he\nprobably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.\nYet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long\nmonths of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in\none hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian\nCape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one\nanother; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on\nthe homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania\nseized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals\nduring the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a\nleg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was\nmoreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to\nlace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a\nstrait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when\nrunning into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stunsails\nspread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,\nthe old mans delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn\nswells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and\nair; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,\nand issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the\ndireful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self,\nraved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.\nWhen you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some\nstill subtler form. Ahabs full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\ncontracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\nnarrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his\nnarrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahabs broad madness had been\nleft behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural\nintellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living\ninstrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy\nstormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its\nconcentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost\nhis strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold\nmore potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one\nreasonable object.",
  "This is much; yet Ahabs larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.\nBut vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding\nfar down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where\nwe here standhowever grand and wonderful, now quit it;and take your\nway, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\nwhere far beneath the fantastic towers of mans upper earth, his root\nof grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique\nburied beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken\nthrone, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\npatient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of\nages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that\nproud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young\nexiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old\nState-secret come.",
  "Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means\nare sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or\nchange, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\ndissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\nwas only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.\nNevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when\nwith ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him\notherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the\nterrible casualty which had overtaken him.",
  "The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\nascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which\nalways afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the\npresent voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,\nthat far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on\naccount of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent\nisle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons\nhe was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full\nof rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and\nscorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable\nidea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart\nhis iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.\nOr, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,\nyet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on\nhis underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,\nthat with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in\nhim, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one\nonly and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one\nof his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking\nin him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have\nwrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on\nprofitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the\nmint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural\nrevenge.",
  "Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses\na Jobs whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made\nup of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibalsmorally enfeebled\nalso, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in\nStarbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in\nStubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so\nofficered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality\nto help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so\naboundingly responded to the old mans ireby what evil magic their\nsouls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the\nWhite Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to\nbewhat the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious\nunderstandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have\nseemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,all this to\nexplain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean\nminer that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by\nthe ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the\nirresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand\nstill? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the\nplace; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see\nnaught in that brute but the deadliest ill.",
  "Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which\ncould not but occasionally awaken in any mans soul some alarm, there\nwas another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,\nwhich at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest;\nand yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost\ndespair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of\nthe whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to\nexplain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I\nmust, else all these chapters might be naught.",
  "Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,\nas if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,\njaponicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way\nrecognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric,\ngrand old kings of Pegu placing the title Lord of the White Elephants\nabove all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the\nmodern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the\nroyal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a\nsnow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Csarian, heir to\noverlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue;\nand though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself,\ngiving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and\nthough, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of\ngladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and\nthough in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is\nmade the emblem of many touching, noble thingsthe innocence of brides,\nthe benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of\nthe white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in\nmany climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of\nthe Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn\nby milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most\naugust religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness\nand power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame\nbeing held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies,\nGreat Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and\nthough to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred\nWhite Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that\nspotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send\nto the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and\nthough directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests\nderive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,\nworn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish\nfaith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of\nour Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to\nthe redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white\nbefore the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there\nwhite like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with\nwhatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an\nelusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more\nof panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.",
  "This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when\ndivorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object\nterrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.\nWitness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the\ntropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the\ntranscendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which\nimparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,\nto the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged\ntiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded\nbear or shark.*",
  "*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who\nwould fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the\nwhiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable\nhideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,\nit might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the\nirresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the\nfleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together\ntwo such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us\nwith so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true;\nyet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified\nterror.",
  "As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that\ncreature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the\nsame quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly\nhit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish\nmass for the dead begins with Requiem eternam (eternal rest), whence\n_Requiem_ denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music.\nNow, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark,\nand the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him _Requin_.",
  "*I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged\ngale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch\nbelow, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the\nmain hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and\nwith a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its\nvast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous\nflutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered\ncries, as some kings ghost in supernatural distress. Through its\ninexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took\nhold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white\nthing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled\nwaters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of\ntowns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only\nhint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and\nturning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!\nnever had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious\nthing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I\nlearned that goney was some seamans name for albatross. So that by no\npossibility could Coleridges wild Rhyme have had aught to do with\nthose mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon\nour deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to\nbe an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a\nlittle brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.",
  "I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird\nchiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in\nthis, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey\nalbatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such\nemotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.",
  "But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will\ntell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.\nAt last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern\ntally round its neck, with the ships time and place; and then letting\nit escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was\ntaken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding,\nthe invoking, and adoring cherubim!",
  "Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the\nWhite Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,\nlarge-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a\nthousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the\nelected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those\ndays were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At\ntheir flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which\nevery evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his\nmane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more\nresplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A\nmost imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western\nworld, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the\nglories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,\nbluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid\nhis aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly\nstreamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his\ncircumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White\nSteed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through\nhis cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to\nthe bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe.\nNor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this\nnoble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so\nclothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it\nwhich, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain\nnameless terror.",
  "What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks\nthe eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is\nthat whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he\nbears. The Albino is as well made as other menhas no substantive\ndeformityand yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him\nmore strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be\nso?",
  "Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not\nthe less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this\ncrowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the\ngauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White\nSquall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice\nomitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of\nthat passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their\nfaction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the\nmarket-place!",
  "Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all\nmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It\ncannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of\nthe dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering\nthere; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of\nconsternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And\nfrom that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the\nshroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail\nto throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in\na milk-white fogYea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that\neven the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on\nhis pallid horse.",
  "But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to\naccount for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by\nthe citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of\nwhitenessthough for the time either wholly or in great part stripped\nof all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,\nbut nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however\nmodified;can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us\nto the hidden cause we seek?",
  "Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,\nand without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And\nthough, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about\nto be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were\nentirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able\nto recall them now.",
  "Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely\nacquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare\nmention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,\nspeechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded\nwith new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of\nthe Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a White\nFriar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?",
  "Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and\nkings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower\nof London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an\nuntravelled American, than those other storied structures, its\nneighborsthe Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer\ntowers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar\nmoods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare\nmention of that name, while the thought of Virginias Blue Ridge is\nfull of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all\nlatitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a\nspectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with\nmortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves,\nfollowed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a\nwholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in\nreading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does the tall pale man\nof the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides\nthrough the green of the groveswhy is this phantom more terrible than\nall the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?",
  "Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling\nearthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the\ntearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide\nfield of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop\n(like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of\nhouse-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;it\nis not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest,\nsaddest city thou canst see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and\nthere is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro,\nthis whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful\ngreenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid\npallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.",
  "I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness\nis not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of\nobjects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there\naught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind\nalmost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when\nexhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or\nuniversality. What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be\nrespectively elucidated by the following examples.",
  "First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if\nby night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels\njust enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under\nprecisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to\nview his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whitenessas if\nfrom encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming\nround him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded\nphantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in\nvain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm\nthey both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him again.\nYet where is the mariner who will tell thee, Sir, it was not so much\nthe fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous\nwhiteness that so stirred me?",
  "Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the\nsnow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the\nmere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast\naltitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to\nlose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the\nbackwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an\nunbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig\nto break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding\nthe scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal\ntrick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and\nhalf shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his\nmisery, views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with\nits lean ice monuments and splintered crosses.",
  "Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of\nVermont, far removed from all beasts of preywhy is it that upon the\nsunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that\nhe cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskinesswhy\nwill he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in\nphrensies of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of\nwild creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange\nmuskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the\nexperience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt,\nof the black bisons of distant Oregon?",
  "No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the\nknowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from\nOregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring\nbison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the\nprairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.",
  "But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and\nlearned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange\nand far more portentouswhy, as we have seen, it is at once the most\nmeaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the\nChristians Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent\nin things the most appalling to mankind.",
  "Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids\nand immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the\nthought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky\nway? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as\nthe visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all\ncolours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness,\nfull of meaning, in a wide landscape of snowsa colourless, all-colour\nof atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory\nof the natural philosophers, that all other earthly huesevery stately\nor lovely emblazoningthe sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea,\nand the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of\nyoung girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent\nin substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified\nNature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover\nnothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and\nconsider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her\nhues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless\nin itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all\nobjects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tingepondering all\nthis, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful\ntravellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring\nglasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at\nthe monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And\nof all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at\nthe fiery hunt?",
  "It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in\na cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to\nthe scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the\nbuckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the\nhallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak\nor rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the\ndeepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the\nsteady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.",
  "Grin away; well see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody\ndown in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I\nsuspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell\nFlask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the\nwind.",
  "Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that\ntook place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his\npurpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the\ntransom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea\ncharts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating\nhimself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various\nlines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady\npencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At\nintervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein\nwere set down the seasons and places in which, on various former\nvoyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.",
  "While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his\nhead, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever\nthrew shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till\nit almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and\ncourses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing\nlines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.",
  "But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\ncabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were\nbrought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and\nothers were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before\nhim, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to\nthe more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.",
  "Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,\nit might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\ncreature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem\nto Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby\ncalculating the driftings of the sperm whales food; and, also, calling\nto mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular\nlatitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to\ncertainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that\nground in search of his prey.",
  "So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\nsperm whales resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\nthat, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\nwere the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\ncollated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to\ncorrespond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the\nflights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to construct\nelaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*",
  "*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by\nan official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\nObservatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it\nappears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\nportions of it are presented in the circular. This chart divides the\nocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of\nlongitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\ncolumns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which\ndistricts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have\nbeen spent in each month in every district, and the two others to\nshow the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been\nseen.",
  "Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the\nsperm whales, guided by some infallible instinctsay, rather, secret\nintelligence from the Deitymostly swim in _veins_, as they are called;\ncontinuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating\nexactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one\ntithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the\ndirection taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyors parallel,\nand though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own\nunavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these\ntimes he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width\n(more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but\nnever exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ships mast-heads, when\ncircumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at\nparticular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating\nwhales may with great confidence be looked for.",
  "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\nfeeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing\nthe widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his\nart, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be\nwholly without prospect of a meeting.",
  "There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\ndelirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,\nperhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons\nfor particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the\nherds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,\nsay, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were\nfound there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and\nunquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In\ngeneral, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the\nsolitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that\nthough Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what\nis called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on\nthe Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to\nvisit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she\nwould infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding\ngrounds, where he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed\nonly his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his\nplaces of prolonged abode. And where Ahabs chances of accomplishing\nhis object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to\nwhatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a\nparticular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities\nwould become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every\npossibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and\nplace were conjoined in the one technical phrasethe\nSeason-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years,\nMoby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for\nawhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted\ninterval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of\nthe deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the\nwaves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot\nwhere the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his\nvengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering\nvigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering\nhunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one\ncrowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those\nhopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\nunquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.",
  "Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\nSeason-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her\ncommander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\nthen running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\nPacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next\nensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequods sailing had,\nperhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very\ncomplexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and\nsixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\nof impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;\nif by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote\nfrom his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow\noff the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any\nother waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas,\nNor-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,\nmight blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the\nPequods circumnavigating wake.",
  "But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it\nnot but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one\nsolitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of\nindividual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti\nin the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar\nsnow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be\nunmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to\nhimself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he\nwould throw himself back in reveriestallied him, and shall he escape?\nHis broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheeps ear!\nAnd here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a\nweariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air\nof the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what\ntrances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one\nunachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes\nwith his own bloody nails in his palms.",
  "Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid\ndreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through\nthe day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them\nround and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing\nof his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was\nsometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up\nfrom its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked\nflames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap\ndown among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild\ncry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would\nburst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on\nfire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms\nof some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the\nplainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the\nscheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab\nthat had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to\nburst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living\nprinciple or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated\nfrom the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its\nouter vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the\nscorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it\nwas no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless\nleagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahabs\ncase, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme\npurpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced\nitself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent\nbeing of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common\nvitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the\nunbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that\nglared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room,\nwas for the time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being,\na ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and\ntherefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts\nhave created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus\nmakes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that\nvulture the very creature he creates.",
  "So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,\nas indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious\nparticulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in\nits earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this\nvolume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and\nmore familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,\nand moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of\nthe entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity\nof the main points of this affair.",
  "First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\nreceiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\ninterval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the\nsame hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same\nprivate cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where\nthree years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I\nthink it may have been something more than that; the man who darted\nthem happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to\nAfrica, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far\ninto the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,\noften endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with\nall the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of\nunknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been\non its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,\nbrushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.\nThis man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the\nother. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this;\nthat is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second\nattack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them,\nafterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so\nfell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the\nlast time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the\nwhales eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say\nthree years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three\ninstances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard\nof many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there\nis no good ground to impeach.",
  "Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant\nthe world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable\nhistorical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at\ndistant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became\nthus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily\npeculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar\nin that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his\npeculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly\nvaluable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences\nof the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\nsuch a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most\nfishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their\ntarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,\nwithout seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some\npoor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they\nmake distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they\npursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump\nfor their presumption.",
  "But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\ncelebrityNay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he\nfamous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,\nbut he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions\nof a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Csar. Was it not\nso, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so\nlong didst lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was\noft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand\nJack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the\nvicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan,\nwhose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white\ncross against the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale,\nmarked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In\nplain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of\nCetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.",
  "But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various\ntimes creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were\nfinally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed\nby valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that\nexpress object as much in view, as in setting out through the\nNarragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture\nthat notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the\nIndian King Philip.",
  "I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make\nmention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in\nprinted form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the\nwhole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For\nthis is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full\nas much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of\nthe plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some\nhints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the\nfishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still\nworse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.",
  "First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general\nperils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid\nconception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.\nOne reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters\nand deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at\nhome, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you\nsuppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by\nthe whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to\nthe bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathando you suppose that\nthat poor fellows name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will\nread to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very\nirregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what\nmight be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I\ntell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific,\namong many others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which\nhad had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that\nhad each lost a boats crew. For Gods sake, be economical with your\nlamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of\nmans blood was spilled for it.",
  "Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale\nis an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that\nwhen narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold\nenormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my\nfacetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of\nbeing facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of\nEgypt.",
  "But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon\ntestimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm\nWhale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously\nmalicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy,\nand sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale _has_ done it.",
  "First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,\nwas cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her\nboats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of\nthe whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping\nfrom the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the\nship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that\nin less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over. Not a\nsurviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest\nexposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being\nreturned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific\nin command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon\nunknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly\nlost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since.\nAt this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen\nOwen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy;\nI have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his\nson; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*",
  "*The following are extracts from Chaces narrative: Every fact seemed\nto warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which\ndirected his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at\na short interval between them, both of which, according to their\ndirection, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made\nahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the\nshock; to effect which, the exact manuvres which he made were\nnecessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\nresentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just\nbefore entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as\nif fired with revenge for their sufferings. Again: At all events, the\nwhole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes,\nand producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided,\ncalculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which\nimpressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am\ncorrect in my opinion.",
  "Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a\nblack night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any\nhospitable shore. The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the\nfears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon\nhidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful\ncontemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moments thought; the\ndismal looking wreck, and _the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale_,\nwholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.",
  "Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J, then\ncommanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be\ndining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in\nthe harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,\nthe Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength\nascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily\ndenied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout\nsloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very\ngood; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set\nsail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on\nthe way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments\nconfidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the\nCommodores craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made\nstraight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not\nsuperstitious, but I consider the Commodores interview with that whale\nas providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a\nsimilar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.",
  "I will now refer you to Langsdorffs Voyages for a little circumstance\nin point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you\nmust know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusensterns\nfamous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century.\nCaptain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:",
  "By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day\nwe were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was\nvery clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to\nkeep on our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was\nnot till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up.\nAn uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship\nitself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived\nby any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full\nsail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its\nstriking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger,\nas this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three\nfeet at least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell\naltogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck,\nconcluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw\nthe monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain\nDWolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the\nvessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very\nhappily it had escaped entirely uninjured.",
  "Now, the Captain DWolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\nquestion, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\nadventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\nDorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I\nhave particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff.\nHe substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large\none: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my\nuncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.",
  "In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,\ntoo, of honest wondersthe voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\nDampiers old chumsI found a little matter set down so like that just\nquoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a\ncorroborative example, if such be needed.",
  "Lionel, it seems, was on his way to John Ferdinando, as he calls the\nmodern Juan Fernandes. In our way thither, he says, about four\noclock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\nleagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which\nput our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where\nthey were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death.\nAnd, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for\ngranted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was\na little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * *\n* * * The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their\ncarriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.\nCaptain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his\ncabin! Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and\nseems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great\nearthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief\nalong the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the\ndarkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all\ncaused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.",
  "I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to\nme, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more\nthan one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\nboats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long\nwithstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\nPusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let\nme say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a\nrunning sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and\nsecured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a\nhorse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if\nthe sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,\nnot so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of\ndestruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent\nindication of his character, that upon being attacked he will\nfrequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for\nseveral consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more\nand a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,\nby which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous\nevent in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but\nthat these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages;\nso that for the millionth time we say amen with SolomonVerily there is\nnothing new under the sun.",
  "In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate\nof Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and\nBelisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own\ntimes, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he\nhas always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating\nhistorian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting\nthe matter presently to be mentioned.",
  "Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\nof his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\nin the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed\nvessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty\nyears. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be\ngainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species\nthis sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as\nwell as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly\ninclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long\ntime I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the\nMediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am\ncertain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the\npresent constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious\nresort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in\nmodern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the\nsperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on\nthe Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the\nskeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes\nthrough the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,\npass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.",
  "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\nsubstance called _brit_ is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\nBut I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\nwhalesquid or cuttle-fishlurks at the bottom of that sea, because\nlarge creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\nfound at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements\ntogether, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\naccording to all human reasoning, Procopiuss sea-monster, that for\nhalf a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all\nprobability have been a sperm whale.",
  "Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\nthoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby\nDick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that\none passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and\nlong habituation far too wedded to a fiery whalemans ways, altogether\nto abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if\nthis were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more\ninfluential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even\nconsidering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the\nWhite Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all\nsperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he\nmultiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would\nprove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be\nindeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,\nthough not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling\npassion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.",
  "To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in\nthe shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,\nfor example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was\nover Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual\nman any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual\nmastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in\na sort of corporeal relation. Starbucks body and Starbucks coerced\nwill were Ahabs, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbucks brain;\nstill he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred\nhis captains quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself\nfrom it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would\nelapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck\nwould ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\ncaptains leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle\ninsanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly\nmanifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing\nthat, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that\nstrange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the\nfull terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\nbackground (for few mens courage is proof against protracted\nmeditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night\nwatches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of\nthan Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had\nhailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are\nmore or less capricious and unreliablethey live in the varying outer\nweather, and they inhale its ficklenessand when retained for any\nobject remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and\npassion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary\ninterests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily\nsuspended for the final dash.",
  "Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion\nmankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.\nThe permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought\nAhab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the\nhearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even\nbreeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for\nthe love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food\nfor their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and\nchivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two\nthousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without\ncommitting burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious\nperquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final\nand romantic objectthat final and romantic object, too many would have\nturned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of\nall hopes of cashaye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some\nmonths go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this\nsame quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would\nsoon cashier Ahab.",
  "Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related\nto Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps\nsomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the\nPequods voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he\nhad indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of\nusurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew\nif so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further\nobedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From\neven the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible\nconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must\nof course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection\ncould only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,\nbacked by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute\natmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be\nsubjected to.",
  "For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be\nverbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good\ndegree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequods\nvoyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force\nhimself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general\npursuit of his profession.",
  "It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging\nabout the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.\nQueequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,\nfor an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet\nsomehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie\nlurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own\ninvisible self.",
  "I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I\nkept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the\nlong yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as\nQueequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword\nbetween the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly\nand unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess\ndid there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only\nbroken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as\nif this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically\nweaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of\nthe warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging\nvibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise\ninterblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed\nnecessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle\nand weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,\nQueequegs impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof\nslantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;\nand by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding\ncontrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savages\nsword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and\nwoof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chanceaye, chance, free\nwill, and necessitynowise incompatibleall interweavingly working\ntogether. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its\nultimate courseits every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending\nto that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;\nand chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of\nnecessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though\nthus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the\nlast featuring blow at events.",
  "Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so\nstrange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of\nfree will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds\nwhence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees\nwas that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly\nforward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden\nintervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that\nvery moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of\nwhalemens look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those\nlungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous\ncadence as from Tashtego the Indians.",
  "The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling\nbefore it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to\nleeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of\nour bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale\nwhen, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while\nconcealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in\nthe opposite quarterthis deceitfulness of his could not now be in\naction; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by\nTashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our\nvicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepersthat is, those not\nappointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the\nmain-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the\nline tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the\nmainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three\nsamphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager\ncrews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly\npoised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-wars men about\nto throw themselves on board an enemys ship.",
  "The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side\nof the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the\ntackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always\nbeen deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the\ncaptains, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The\nfigure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white\ntooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese\njacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black\ntrowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness\nwas a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and\ncoiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the\ncompanions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion\npeculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;a race\nnotorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white\nmariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents\non the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose\nto be elsewhere.",
  "Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the\nmen sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with\na wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a\ndexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the\nsailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ships side into the tossed\nboats below.",
  "Hardly had they pulled out from under the ships lee, when a fourth\nkeel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and\nshowed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the\nstern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves\nwidely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their\neyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of\nthe other boats obeyed not the command.",
  "Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little\nones, drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom\nstill showed signs of uneasiness. Why dont you break your backbones,\nmy boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They\nare only five more hands come to help usnever mind from wherethe more\nthe merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstonedevils are\ngood fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; thats the stroke for a\nthousand pounds; thats the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the\ngold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, menall hearts alive!\nEasy, easy; dont be in a hurrydont be in a hurry. Why dont you snap\nyour oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so,\nthen:softly, softly! Thats itthats it! long and strong. Give way\nthere, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are\nall asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull,\ncant ye? pull, wont ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes\ndont ye pull?pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!\nHere! whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; every mothers\nson of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth.\nThats itthats it. Now ye do something; that looks like it, my\nsteel-bits. Start herstart her, my silver-spoons! Start her,\nmarling-spikes!",
  "Stubbs exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had\nrather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in\ninculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this\nspecimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions\nwith his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief\npeculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a\ntone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so\ncalculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear\nsuch queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling\nfor the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy\nand indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so\nbroadly gapedopen-mouthed at timesthat the mere sight of such a\nyawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon\nthe crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,\nwhose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all\ninferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.",
  "Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,\nboys!) in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: A sad\nbusiness, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,\nMr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what\nwill. (Spring, my men, spring!) Theres hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.\nStubb, and thats what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperms the\nplay! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.",
  "Aye, aye, I thought as much, soliloquized Stubb, when the boats\ndiverged, as soon as I clapt eye on em, I thought so. Aye, and thats\nwhat he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long\nsuspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whales at the bottom\nof it. Well, well, so be it! Cant be helped! All right! Give way, men!\nIt aint the White Whale to-day! Give way!",
  "Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant\nas the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably\nawakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ships\ncompany; but Archys fancied discovery having some time previous got\nabroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some\nsmall measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge\nof their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubbs confident way of\naccounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from\nsuperstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room\nfor all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahabs precise agency in\nthe matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the\nmysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the\ndim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the\nunaccountable Elijah.",
  "Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the\nfurthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a\ncircumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger\nyellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five\ntrip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which\nperiodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst\nboiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen\npulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and\ndisplayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the\ngunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery\nhorizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a\nfencers, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance\nany tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar\nas in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All\nat once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained\nfixed, while the boats five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat\nand crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in\nthe rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily\ndown into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the\nmovement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.",
  "Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage\nstood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the\nspot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme\nstern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with\nthe gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing\nhimself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently\neyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.",
  "Not very far distant Flasks boat was also lying breathlessly still;\nits commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a\nstout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above\nthe level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the\nwhale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a mans hand,\nand standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the\nmast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little\nKing-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post\nwas full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead\nstand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.",
  "Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the\nboat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to\nFlasks foot, and then putting Flasks hand on his hearse-plumed head\nand bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous\nfling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was\nFlask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a\nbreastband to lean against and steady himself by.",
  "At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous\nhabitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect\nposture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously\nperverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily\nperched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the\nsight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more\ncurious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy,\nunthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the\nsea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired\nFlask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider.\nThough truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now\nand then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby\ngive to the negros lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity\nstamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her\ntides and her seasons for that.",
  "Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing\nsolicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,\nnot a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,\nStubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the\nlanguishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,\nwhere he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed\nhome the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his\nmatch across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his\nharpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed\nstars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,\ncrying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, Down, down all, and give\nway!there they are!",
  "To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been\nvisible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white\nwater, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and\nsuffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\nrolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\nwere, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\natmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\nwater, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other\nindications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning\ncouriers and detached flying outriders.",
  "Pull, pull, my good boys, said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but\nintensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance\nfrom his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two\nvisible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much\nto his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the\nsilence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his\npeculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.",
  "How different the loud little King-Post. Sing out and say something,\nmy hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on\ntheir black backs, boys; only do that for me, and Ill sign over to you\nmy Marthas Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children,\nboys. Lay me onlay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring\nmad! See! see that white water! And so shouting, he pulled his hat\nfrom his head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up,\nflirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and\nplunging in the boats stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.",
  "Look at that chap now, philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his\nunlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a\nshort distance, followed afterHes got fits, that Flask has. Fits?\nyes, give him fitsthats the very wordpitch fits into em. Merrily,\nmerrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;merrys the word.\nPull, babespull, sucklingspull, all. But what the devil are you\nhurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and\nkeep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your\nknives in twothats all. Take it easywhy dont ye take it easy, I\nsay, and burst all your livers and lungs!",
  "But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of\nhisthese were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed\nlight of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious\nseas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of\nred murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.",
  "Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of\nFlask to that whale, as he called the fictitious monster which he\ndeclared to be incessantly tantalizing his boats bow with its\ntailthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that\nthey would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look\nover the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must\nput out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage\npronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but\narms, in these critical moments.",
  "It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the\nomnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled\nalong the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless\nbowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip\nfor an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost\nseemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the\nwatery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the\ntop of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other\nside;all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and\nthe shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the\nivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like\na wild hen after her screaming brood;all this was thrilling.",
  "Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever\nheat of his first battle; not the dead mans ghost encountering the\nfirst unknown phantom in the other world;neither of these can feel\nstranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first\ntime finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the\nhunted sperm whale.",
  "The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and\nmore visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows\nflung upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted\neverywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.\nThe boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales\nrunning dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still\nrising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through\nthe water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to\nescape being torn from the row-locks.",
  "Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril\nso close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance\nof the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent\ninstant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of\nfifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still\nbooming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like\nthe erected crests of enraged serpents.",
  "A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of\nQueequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from\nastern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail\ncollapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;\nsomething rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole\ncrew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the\nwhite curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all\nblended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.",
  "Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round\nit we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,\ntumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea,\nthe water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing\neyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the\nbottom of the ocean.",
  "The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;\nthe whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white\nfire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal\nin these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar\nto the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those\nboats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew\ndarker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.\nThe rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were\nuseless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.\nSo, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many\nfailures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then\nstretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the\nstandard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up\nthat imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. There,\nthen, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly\nholding up hope in the midst of despair.",
  "Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,\nwe lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over\nthe sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.\nSuddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.\nWe all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled\nby the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were\ndimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the\nsea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us\nwithin a distance of not much more than its length.",
  "Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it\ntossed and gaped beneath the ships bows like a chip at the base of a\ncataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no\nmore till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were\ndashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely\nlanded on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut\nloose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship\nhad given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon\nsome token of our perishing,an oar or a lance pole.",
  "There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed\naffair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast\npractical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more\nthan suspects that the joke is at nobodys expense but his own.\nHowever, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He\nbolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all\nhard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich\nof potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for\nsmall difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril\nof life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,\ngood-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen\nand unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am\nspeaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation;\nit comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before\nmight have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part\nof the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to\nbreed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with\nit I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White\nWhale its object.",
  "Queequeg, said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the\ndeck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the\nwater; Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often\nhappen? Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he\ngave me to understand that such things did often happen.",
  "Mr. Stubb, said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his\noil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; Mr. Stubb, I\nthink I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief\nmate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose\nthen, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy\nsquall is the height of a whalemans discretion?",
  "Mr. Flask, said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing\nclose by; you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you\ntell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask,\nfor an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into\ndeaths jaws?",
  "Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement\nof the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings\nin the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of\ncommon occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the\nsuperlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign\nmy life into the hands of him who steered the boatoftentimes a fellow\nwho at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of\nscuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that\nthe particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be\nimputed to Starbucks driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a\nsquall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for\nhis great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to\nthis uncommonly prudent Starbucks boat; and finally considering in\nwhat a devils chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking\nall things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make\na rough draft of my will. Queequeg, said I, come along, you shall be\nmy lawyer, executor, and legatee.",
  "It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at\ntheir last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world\nmore fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical\nlife that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded\nupon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled\naway from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as\ngood as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a\nsupplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might\nbe. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.\nI looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a\nclean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.",
  "Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering\nthe paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it\nis right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active\nperils of the chase. So Tamerlanes soldiers often argued with tears in\ntheir eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried\ninto the thickest of the fight.",
  "But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that\nwith two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;\nconsidering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and\nextraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then\ncomprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed\nman to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the\njoint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.",
  "Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of\nhis entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of\nthe chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving\nhis orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually\napportioned to him as a regular headsman in the huntabove all for\nCaptain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boats\ncrew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads\nof the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boats\ncrew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.\nNevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that\nmatter. Until Cabacos published discovery, the sailors had little\nforeseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of\nport, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the\nwhaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then\nfound bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his\nown hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even\nsolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is\nrunning out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was\nobserved in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra\ncoat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better\nwithstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety\nhe evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it\nis sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boats bow for bracing\nthe knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was\nobserved how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee\nfixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the\ncarpenters chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a\nlittle there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and\ncuriosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this\nparticular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to\nthe ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his\nintention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition\ndid by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boats crew\nbeing assigned to that boat.",
  "Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned\naway; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such\nunaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown\nnooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of\nwhalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway\ncreatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,\noars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that\nBeelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin\nto chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable\nexcitement in the forecastle.",
  "But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate\nphantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were\nsomehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a\nmuffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like\nthis, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be\nlinked with Ahabs peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort\nof a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even\nauthority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an\nindifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as\ncivilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their\ndreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide\namong the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles\nto the east of the continentthose insulated, immemorial, unalterable\ncountries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the\nghostly aboriginalness of earths primal generations, when the memory\nof the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his\ndescendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real\nphantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and\nto what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed\nconsorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the\nuncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.",
  "Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly\nswept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off\nthe Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of\nthe Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery\nlocality, southerly from St. Helena.",
  "It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and\nmoonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;\nand, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery\nsilence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen\nfar in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it\nlooked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from\nthe sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight\nnights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a\nlook-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,\nthough herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a\nhundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what\nemotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at\nsuch unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But\nwhen, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive\nnights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,\nhis unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,\nevery reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit\nhad lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. There she\nblows! Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered\nmore; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was\na most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously\nexciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a\nlowering.",
  "Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the\ntgallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The\nbest man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head\nmanned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,\nupheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows\nof so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air\nbeneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic\ninfluences were struggling in herone to mount direct to heaven, the\nother to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched\nAhabs face that night, you would have thought that in him also two\ndifferent things were warring. While his one live leg made lively\nechoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a\ncoffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship\nso swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager\nglances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every\nsailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.",
  "This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days\nafter, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it\nwas descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it\ndisappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after\nnight, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted\ninto the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;\ndisappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and\nsomehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still\nfurther and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever\nalluring us on.",
  "Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance\nwith the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested\nthe Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that\nwhenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however\nfar apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by\none self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there\nreigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as\nif it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the\nmonster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest\nand most savage seas.",
  "These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a\nwondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in\nwhich, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a\ndevilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so\nwearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful\nerrand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.",
  "But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began\nhowling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas\nthat are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the\nblast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of\nsilver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this\ndesolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more\ndismal than before.",
  "Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither\nbefore us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And\nevery morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and\nspite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,\nas though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a\nthing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for\ntheir homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved\nthe black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great\nmundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering\nit had bred.",
  "Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called\nof yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had\nattended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where\nguilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed\ncondemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat\nthat black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and\nunvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still\nbeckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be\ndescried.",
  "During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for\nthe time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous\ndeck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever\naddressed his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything\nabove and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but\npassively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become\npractical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its\naccustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for\nhours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an\noccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very\neyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of\nthe ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,\nstood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to\nguard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a\nsort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened\nbelt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by\npainted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift\nmadness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness\nof humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence\nthe men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the\nblast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not\nseek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old\nmans aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the\nbarometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his\nfloor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from\nwhich he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the\nunremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of\nthose charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken\nof. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body\nwas erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were\npointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in\nthe ceiling.*",
  "South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising\nground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross)\nby name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the\nfore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro\nin the far ocean fisheriesa whaler at sea, and long absent from home.",
  "As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the\nskeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral\nappearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all\nher spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred\nover with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it\nwas to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They\nseemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment\nthat had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops\nnailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and\nthough, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men\nin the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped\nfrom the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those\nforlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not\none word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being\nheard from below.",
  "But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in\nthe act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his\nhand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to\nmake himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing\nthe distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the\nPequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the\nfirst mere mention of the White Whales name to another ship, Ahab for\na moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a\nboat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But\ntaking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet,\nand knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer\nand shortly bound home, he loudly hailedAhoy there! This is the\nPequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters\nto the Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home,\ntell them to address them to",
  "At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,\nin accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,\nthat for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side,\ndarted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves\nfore and aft with the strangers flanks. Though in the course of his\ncontinual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar\nsight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously\ncarry meanings.",
  "Swim away from me, do ye? murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.\nThere seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of\ndeep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced.\nBut turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in\nthe wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion\nvoice,Up helm! Keep her off round the world!",
  "Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for\never reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange\nthan any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise\nin the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in\ntormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims\nbefore all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they\neither lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.",
  "The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had\nspoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this\nnot been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded\nherjudging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasionsif so it had\nbeen that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer\nto the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not\nto consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he\ncould contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But\nall this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said\nhere of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other\nin foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.",
  "If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the\nequally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering\neach other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of\nthem, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment\nto interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and\nresting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the\nillimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling\nvessels descrying each other at the ends of the earthoff lone\nFannings Island, or the far away Kings Mills; how much more natural,\nI say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only\ninterchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and\nsociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of\ncourse, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose\ncaptains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to\neach other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to\ntalk about.",
  "For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on\nboard; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a\ndate a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and\nthumb-worn files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound\nship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the\ncruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost\nimportance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning\nwhaling vessels crossing each others track on the cruising-ground\nitself, even though they are equally long absent from home. For one of\nthem may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and now\nfar remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of\nthe ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling news,\nand have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all the\nsympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar\ncongenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared\nprivations and perils.",
  "Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;\nthat is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case\nwith Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number\nof English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when\nthey do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them;\nfor your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not\nfancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English\nwhalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the\nAmerican whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his\nnondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this\nsuperiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be\nhard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill\nmore whales than all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this\nis a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the\nNantucketer does not take much to heart; probably, because he knows\nthat he has a few foibles himself.",
  "So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the\nwhalers have most reason to be sociableand they are so. Whereas, some\nmerchant ships crossing each others wake in the mid-Atlantic, will\noftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,\nmutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies\nin Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism\nupon each others rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at\nsea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and\nscrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be\nmuch right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As\ntouching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry,\nthey run away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates,\nwhen they chance to cross each others cross-bones, the first hail\nisHow many skulls?the same way that whalers hailHow many\nbarrels? And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer\napart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and dont like to\nsee overmuch of each others villanous likenesses.",
  "But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\nfree-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another\nwhaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a _Gam_, a thing so\nutterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name\neven; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,\nand repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubber-boilers, and\nsuch like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and\nalso all Pirates and Man-of-Wars men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish\nsuch a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it\nwould be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should\nlike to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory\nabout it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at\nthe gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion,\nhe has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I\nconclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman,\nin that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.",
  "But what is a _Gam?_ You might wear out your index-finger running up\nand down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr.\nJohnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Websters ark does not\nhold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years\nbeen in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees.\nCertainly, it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the\nLexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.",
  "There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten\nhere. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so\nhas the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the\ncaptain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern\nsheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often\nsteers himself with a pretty little milliners tiller decorated with\ngay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa\nof that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if\nwhaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old\naldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never\nadmits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete\nboats crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or\nharpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the\noccasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to\nhis visit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that\nbeing conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him\nfrom the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to\nthe importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor\nis this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting\nsteering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the\nafter-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus\ncompletely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself\nsideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent\npitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of\nfoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a\nspread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,\nit would never do in plain sight of the worlds riveted eyes, it would\nnever do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying\nhimself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his\nhands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he\ngenerally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets; but perhaps being\ngenerally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.\nNevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones\ntoo, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment\nor two, in a sudden squall sayto seize hold of the nearest oarsmans\nhair, and hold on there like grim death.",
  "It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another\nhomeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned\nalmost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us\nstrong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White\nWhale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Hos\nstory, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain\nwondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of\nGod which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter\ncircumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may\nbe called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never\nreached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of\nthe story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the\nprivate property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of\nwhom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of\nsecrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and\nrevealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could\nnot well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did\nthis thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full\nknowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were\nthey governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among\nthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequods main-mast.\nInterweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as\npublicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now\nproceed to put on lasting record.",
  "For my humors sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once\nnarrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one\nsaints eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden\nInn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were\non the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they\noccasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.",
  "Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about\nrehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,\nwas cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days sail eastward\nfrom the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the\nnorthward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according\nto daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold\nthan common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But\nthe captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good\nluck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to\nquit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous,\nthough, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low\ndown as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued\nher cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy\nintervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was\nthe leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that\nnow taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the\nnearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and\nrepaired.",
  "Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance\nfavoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the\nway, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically\nrelieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the\nship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well\nnigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous\nbreezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at\nher port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been\nfor the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the\nbitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from\nBuffalo.",
  "On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; butI crave your\ncourtesymay be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,\ngentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as\nlarge and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far\nManilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet\nbeen nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly\nconnected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,\nthose grand fresh-water seas of ours,Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and\nSuperior, and Michigan,possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many\nof the oceans noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of\nraces and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic\nisles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by\ntwo great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long\nmaritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East,\ndotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by\nbatteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they\nhave heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they\nyield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash\nfrom out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by\nancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried\nlines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild\nAfric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give\nrobes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and\nCleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the\nfull-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,\nand the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as\ndireful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks\nare, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full\nmany a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen,\nthough an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean\nnurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney,\nthough in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket\nbeach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long\nfollowed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was\nhe quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods\nseaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet\nwas this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this\nLakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by\ninflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human\nrecognition which is the meanest slaves right; thus treated, this\nSteelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he\nhad proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and\nSteelkiltbut, gentlemen, you shall hear.",
  "It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her\nprow for her island haven, that the Town-Hos leak seemed again\nincreasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps\nevery day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our\nAtlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their\nwhole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the\nofficer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the\nprobability would be that he and his shipmates would never again\nremember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.\nNor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,\ngentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their\npump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length;\nthat is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other\nreasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is\nin some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless\nlatitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.",
  "Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found\ngaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by\nseveral of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the\nupper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way\nexpanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a\ncoward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness\ntouching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or\non sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he\nbetrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the\nseamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner\nin her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was\non this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they\nstood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear\nwater; clear as any mountain spring, gentlementhat bubbling from the\npumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at\nthe lee scupper-holes.",
  "Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional\nworld of ourswatery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command\nover his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his\nsuperior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he\nconceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a\nchance he will pull down and pulverize that subalterns tower, and make\na little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,\ngentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a\nhead like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled\nhousings of your last viceroys snorting charger; and a brain, and a\nheart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt\nCharlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagnes father. But Radney,\nthe mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.\nHe did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.",
  "Aye, aye, my merry lads, its a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\none of ye, and lets have a taste. By the Lord, its worth bottling! I\ntell ye what, men, old Rads investment must go for it! he had best cut\naway his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that\nsword-fish only began the job; hes come back again with a gang of\nship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole\nposse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom;\nmaking improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, Id tell him\nto jump overboard and scatter em. Theyre playing the devil with his\nestate, I can tell him. But hes a simple old soul,Rad, and a beauty\ntoo. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in\nlooking-glasses. I wonder if hed give a poor devil like me the model\nof his nose.",
  "Aye, aye, sir, said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. Lively, boys,\nlively, now! And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;\nthe men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping\nof the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of lifes\nutmost energies.",
  "Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went\nforward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face\nfiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his\nbrow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney\nto meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know\nnot; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate\ncommanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a\nshovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a\npig to run at large.",
  "Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ships deck at sea is a piece of household\nwork which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\nevening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\nfoundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\nsea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\nwould not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all\nvessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,\nif boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the\nTown-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps;\nand being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been\nregularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should\nhave been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly\nnautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all\nthese particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair\nstood between the two men.",
  "But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\nplainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat\nin his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\nunderstand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\nfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat\nstill for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mates\nmalignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him\nand the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\ninstinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness\nto stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful beinga\nrepugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when\naggrievedthis nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over\nSteelkilt.",
  "Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\nexhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping\nthe deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then,\nwithout at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the\ncustomary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done\nlittle or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a\nmost domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\ncommand; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an\nuplifted coopers club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near\nby.",
  "Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\nall his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt\ncould but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still\nsmothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained\ndoggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the\nhammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do\nhis bidding.",
  "Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\nfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\nhis intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\nnot the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\nhis twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\nwas to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the\nwindlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him\nthat he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\nLakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:",
  "Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to\nyourself. But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where\nthe Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of\nhis teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.\nRetreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye\nwith the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his\nright hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his\npersecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would\nmurder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter\nby the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant\nthe lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch\nspouting blood like a whale.",
  "For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire\nbreadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and\nmost thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and\naffluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room\nand bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman\narches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or\nbroken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk\ncounties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires\nstand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly\ncorrupt and often lawless life. Theres your true Ashantee, gentlemen;\nthere howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;\nunder the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.\nFor by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan\nfreebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so\nsinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.",
  "A moment! Pardon! cried another of the company. In the name of all\nus Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by\nno means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for\ndistant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look\nsurprised; you know the proverb all along this coastCorrupt as Lima.\nIt but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than\nbilliard-tables, and for ever openand Corrupt as Lima. So, too,\nVenice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.\nMark!St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now, you\npour out again.",
  "Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would\nmake a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is\nhe. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery\nNile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked\nCleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,\nall this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller\nso proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his\ngrand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages\nthrough which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not\nunshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received\ngood turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would\nfain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming\nqualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm\nto back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In\nsum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is\nemphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so\nmany of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of\nmankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling\ncaptains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter,\nthat to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its\nline, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole\ntransition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and\nrecklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.",
  "I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly\nhad he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and\nthe four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down\nthe ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the\nuproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.\nOthers of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted\nturmoil ensued; while standing out of harms way, the valiant captain\ndanced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to\nmanhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the\nquarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of\nthe confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to\nprick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his\ndesperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the\nforecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks\nin a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves\nbehind the barricade.",
  "Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,\ndefied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to\nunderstand distinctly, that his (Steelkilts) death would be the signal\nfor a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart\nlest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but\nstill commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.",
  "The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye\non the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:Its not our\nfault; we didnt want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was\nboys business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to\nprick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his\ncursed jaw; aint those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,\nmen? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to\nyourself; say the word; dont be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to\nturn to; treat us decently, and were your men; but we wont be\nflogged.",
  "Look ye, now, cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,\nthere are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for\nthe cruise, dye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our\ndischarge as soon as the anchor is down; so we dont want a row; its\nnot our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we\nwont be flogged.",
  "Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:I tell you what\nit is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby\nrascal, we wont lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till\nyou say the word about not flogging us, we dont do a hands turn.",
  "As the Lakemans bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain\nand his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide\nof the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called\nfor the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the\ncompanionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered\nsomething down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon themten\nin numberleaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had\nremained neutral.",
  "All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and\naft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at\nwhich last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after\nbreaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed\nin peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the\npumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary\nnight dismally resounded through the ship.",
  "At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,\nsummoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was\nthen lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were\ntossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,\nthe Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three\ndays this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling,\nand then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;\nand suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were\nready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet,\nunited perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained\nthem to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain\nreiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a\nterrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he\nbelonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up\ninto the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain\nthem. Only three were left.",
  "It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of\nseven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had\nlast hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as\nblack as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to\nthe two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst\nout of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with\ntheir keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a\nhandle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if\nby any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For\nhimself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.\nThat was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met\nwith no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were\nready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a\nsurrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first\nman on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this\ntheir leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;\nparticularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other,\nin the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder\nwould but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play\nof these miscreants must come out.",
  "Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own\nseparate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece\nof treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be\nthe first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and\nthereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might\nmerit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead\nthem to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of\nvillany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their\nleader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in\nthree sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with\ncords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.",
  "Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he\nand all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a\nfew minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still\nstruggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious\nallies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been\nfully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along\nthe deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the\nmizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till\nmorning. Damn ye, cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,\nthe vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!",
  "At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had\nrebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the\nformer that he had a good mind to flog them all roundthought, upon the\nwhole, he would do sohe ought tojustice demanded it; but for the\npresent, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with\na reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.",
  "But as for you, ye carrion rogues, turning to the three men in the\nriggingfor you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots; and, seizing\na rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two\ntraitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads\nsideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.",
  "But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale\nman, with a bandaged head, arrested themRadney the chief mate. Ever\nsince the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the\ntumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the\nwhole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly\nspeak; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do\nwhat the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced\nto his pinioned foe.",
  "So I am, but take that. The mate was in the very act of striking,\nwhen another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing\nno more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilts threat, whatever that\nmight have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were\nturned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps\nclanged as before.",
  "Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor\nwas heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,\nbesieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.\nEntreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own\ninstance they were put down in the ships run for salvation. Still, no\nsign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,\nthat mainly at Steelkilts instigation, they had resolved to maintain\nthe strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the\nship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the\nspeediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thingnamely,\nnot to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,\nspite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\nmaintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower\nfor a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\ncruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\nberth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the\nvital jaw of the whale.",
  "But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\npassiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till\nall was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the\nman who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney\nthe chief mates watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more\nthan half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he\ninsisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the\nhead of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other\ncircumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.",
  "During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\nbulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of\nthe boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ships side. In\nthis attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a\nconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between\nthis was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his\nnext trick at the helm would come round at two oclock, in the morning\nof the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his\nleisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully\nin his watches below.",
  "Why not? Do you think he wont do me a turn, when its to help\nhimself in the end, shipmate? and going to the mate, he looked at him\nquietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given\nhimneither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an\niron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the\nLakemans monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock\nfor a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent\nhelmnigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready\ndug to the seamans handthat fatal hour was then to come; and in the\nfore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and\nstretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.",
  "But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody\ndeed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the\navenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in\nto take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have\ndone.",
  "It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\nday, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe\nman, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, There\nshe rolls! there she rolls! Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.",
  "No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.Now, gentlemen, so\nsuddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the\nshipforgetful of the compact among the crewin the excitement of the\nmoment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted\nhis voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been\nplainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.\nThe White Whalethe White Whale! was the cry from captain, mates, and\nharpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to\ncapture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed\naskance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,\nthat lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a\nliving opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality\npervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out\nbefore the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of\nthe mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,\nwhile Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or\nslacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats\nwere lowered, the mates got the start; and none howled more fiercely\nwith delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a\nstiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney\nsprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.\nAnd now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whales topmost back.\nNothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding\nfoam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat\nstruck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the\nstanding mate. That instant, as he fell on the whales slippery back,\nthe boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was\ntossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck\nout through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that\nveil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But\nthe whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer\nbetween his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,\nand went down.",
  "Meantime, at the first tap of the boats bottom, the Lakeman had\nslackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly\nlooking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,\ndownward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He\ncut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose\nagain, with some tatters of Radneys red woollen shirt, caught in the\nteeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the\nwhale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.",
  "In good time, the Town-Ho reached her porta savage, solitary\nplacewhere no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the\nLakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted\namong the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double\nwar-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.",
  "The ships company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called\nupon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving\ndown the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over\ntheir dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both\nby night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,\nthat upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a\nweakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so\nheavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the\nship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon\nfrom the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the\nIslanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with\nhim, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight\nbefore the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a\nreinforcement to his crew.",
  "On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which\nseemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from\nit; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of\nSteelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The\ncaptain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked\nwar-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the\npistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and\nfoam.",
  "Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the\nroots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due\ntime arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck\nbefriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were\nprovidentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor\nheaded. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former\ncaptain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.",
  "Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,\nand the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized\nTahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small\nnative schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all\nright there, again resumed his cruisings.",
  "So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye,\ngentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be\ntrue; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I\nhave seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.",
  "I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\nsomething like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the\neye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored\nalongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.\nIt may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious\nimaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day\nconfidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the\nworld right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all\nwrong.",
  "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will\nbe found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For\never since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble\npanellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,\nmedallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of\nchain-armor like Saladins, and a helmeted head like St. Georges; ever\nsince then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not\nonly in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\npresentations of him.",
  "Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\nto be the whales, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\nElephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless\nsculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,\nevery conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of\nthem actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our\nnoble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The\nHindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,\ndepicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly\nknown as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and\nhalf whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small\nsection of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an\nanaconda, than the broad palms of the true whales majestic flukes.",
  "But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\npainters portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the\nantediluvian Hindoo. It is Guidos picture of Perseus rescuing\nAndromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model\nof such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the\nsame scene in his own Perseus Descending, make out one whit better.\nThe huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the\nsurface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on\nits back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are\nrolling, might be taken for the Traitors Gate leading from the Thames\nby water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old\nScotch Sibbald, and Jonahs whale, as depicted in the prints of old\nBibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for\nthe book-binders whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a\ndescending anchoras stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of\nmany books both old and newthat is a very picturesque but purely\nfabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on\nantique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless\ncall this book-binders fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so\nintended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an\nold Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\nRevival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\ncomparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\nspecies of the Leviathan.",
  "In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\nwill at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all\nmanner of spouts, jets deau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\nBaden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the\ntitle-page of the original edition of the Advancement of Learning you\nwill find some curious whales.",
  "But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\npictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,\nby those who know. In old Harriss collection of voyages there are some\nplates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,\nentitled A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the\nWhale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master. In one of those plates the\nwhales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among\nice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another\nplate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with\nperpendicular flukes.",
  "Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\nColnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled A Voyage round\nCape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\nSpermaceti Whale Fisheries. In this book is an outline purporting to\nbe a Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from\none killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.\nI doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the\nbenefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say\nthat it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale,\nto a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a\nbow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not\ngive us Jonah looking out of that eye!",
  "Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the\nbenefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of\nmistake. Look at that popular work Goldsmiths Animated Nature. In\nthe abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged\nwhale and a narwhale. I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this\nunsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the\nnarwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this\nnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon\nany intelligent public of schoolboys.",
  "Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacpde, a great\nnaturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\nseveral pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these\nare not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland\nwhale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long\nexperienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its\ncounterpart in nature.",
  "But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\nreserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\nBaron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he\ngives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that\npicture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary\nretreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuviers Sperm Whale is\nnot a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of\na whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\npicture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor\nin the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that\nis, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the\npencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.",
  "As for the sign-painters whales seen in the streets hanging over the\nshops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally\nRichard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;\nbreakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of\nmariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\npaint.",
  "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\nsurprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have\nbeen taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a\ndrawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent\nthe noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.\nThough elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living\nLeviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The\nliving whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen\nat sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out\nof sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element\nit is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily\ninto the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.\nAnd, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour\nbetween a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan;\nyet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a\nships deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying\nshape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not\ncatch.",
  "But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\nwhale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at\nall. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\nthat his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though\nJeremy Benthams skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of\none of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed\nutilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremys other leading personal\ncharacteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any\nleviathans articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the\nmere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully\ninvested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so\nroundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the\nhead, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is\nalso very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which\nalmost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the\nthumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,\nand little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy\ncovering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. However\nrecklessly the whale may sometimes serve us, said humorous Stubb one\nday, he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.",
  "For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs\nconclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world\nwhich must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the\nmark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very\nconsiderable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding\nout precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in\nwhich you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by\ngoing a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of\nbeing eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you\nhad best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this\nLeviathan.",
  "I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;\nColnetts, Hugginss, Frederick Cuviers, and Beales. In the previous\nchapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Hugginss is far\nbetter than theirs; but, by great odds, Beales is the best. All\nBeales drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in\nthe picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second\nchapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no\ndoubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is\nadmirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the\nSperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;\nbut they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.",
  "Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they\nare drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has\nbut one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency,\nbecause it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you\ncan derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by\nhis living hunters.",
  "But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details\nnot the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be\nanywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and\ntaken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent\nattacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble\nSperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath\nthe boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the\nair upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of\nthe boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the\nmonsters spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single\nincomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the\nincensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if\nfrom a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and\ntrue. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden\npoles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the\nswimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions\nof affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing\ndown upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical\ndetails of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I\ncould not draw so good a one.",
  "In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\nthe barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\nblack weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\nPatagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\nthat from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\nmust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are\npecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\nmaccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\nback. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through\nthe deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and\ncausing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh\nthe paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all\nraging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the\nglassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the\npowerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered\nfortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole\ninserted into his spout-hole.",
  "Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he\nwas either practically conversant with his subject, or else\nmarvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the\nlads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe,\nand where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing\ncommotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the\nbeholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great\nbattles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern\nLights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a\ncharge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that\ngallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.",
  "The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of\nthings seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings\nthey have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of Englands\nexperience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the\nAmericans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only\nfinished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the\nwhale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale\ndraughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical\noutline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so\nfar as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to\nsketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned\nRight whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland\nwhale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and\nporpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks,\nchopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a\nLeuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six\nfac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement\nto the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so\nimportant a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured\nfor every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of\nthe Peace.",
  "In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other\nFrench engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself\nH. Durand. One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present\npurpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet\nnoon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored,\ninshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened\nsails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background,\nboth drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine,\nwhen considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen\nunder one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving\nis quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in\nthe very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside;\nthe vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to\na quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,\nis about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and\nlances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in\nits hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands\nhalf-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the\nsmoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke\nover a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up\nwith earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the\nexcited seamen.",
  "On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a\ncrippled beggar (or _kedger_, as the sailors say) holding a painted\nboard before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his\nleg. There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats\n(presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is\nbeing crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten\nyears, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited\nthat stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification\nhas now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever\npublished in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a\nstump as any you will find in the western clearings. But, though for\never mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman\nmake; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own\namputation.",
  "Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag\nHarbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and\nwhaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm\nWhale-teeth, or ladies busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and\nother like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous\nlittle ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough\nmaterial, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little\nboxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the\nskrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their\njack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,\nthey will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariners\nfancy.",
  "Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man\nto that condition in which God placed him, _i.e._ what is called\nsavagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I\nmyself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the\nCannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.",
  "Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic\nhours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian\nwar-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of\ncarving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.\nFor, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a sharks tooth, that\nmiraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has\ncost steady years of steady application.",
  "As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the\nsame marvellous patience, and with the same single sharks tooth, of\nhis one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not\nquite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as\nthe Greek savage, Achilless shield; and full of barbaric spirit and\nsuggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert\nDurer.",
  "At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung\nby the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is\nsleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales\nare seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some\nold-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for\nweather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all\nintents and purposes so labelled with _Hands off!_ you cannot examine\nthem closely enough to decide upon their merit.",
  "In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken\ncliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,\nyou will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the\nLeviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against\nthem in a surf of green surges.",
  "Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is\ncontinually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from\nsome lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the\nprofiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges. But you must be\na thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you\nwish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the\nexact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point,\nelse so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your\nprecise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery;\nlike the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita, though once\nhigh-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.",
  "Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out\ngreat whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as\nwhen long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies\nlocked in battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased\nLeviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright\npoints that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent\nAntarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase\nagainst the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and\nthe Flying Fish.",
  "On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from\nthe attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly\nswam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that\nwondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated\nfrom the water that escaped at the lip.",
  "*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the Brazil Banks does\nnot bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there\nbeing shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable\nmeadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually\nfloating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.",
  "But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at\nall reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when\nthey paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms\nlooked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in\nthe great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will\nsometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them\nto be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil;\neven so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species\nof the leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their\nimmense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such\nbulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with\nthe same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.",
  "Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the\ndeep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though\nsome old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are\nof their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the\nthing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for\nexample, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to\nthe sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any\ngeneric respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.",
  "But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas\nhave ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and\nrepelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,\nso that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his\none superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of\nall mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen\ntens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;\nthough but a moments consideration will teach, that however baby man\nmay brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering\nfuture, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,\nto the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize\nthe stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the\ncontinual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense\nof the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.",
  "The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese\nvengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.\nThat same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships\nof last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noahs flood is not yet subsided;\ntwo thirds of the fair world it yet covers.",
  "Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a\nmiracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,\nwhen under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and\nswallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in\nprecisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.",
  "But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it\nis also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who\nmurdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath\nspawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her\nown cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the\nrocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of\nships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting\nlike a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean\noverruns the globe.",
  "Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures\nglide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously\nhidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish\nbrilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the\ndainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once\nmore, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey\nupon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.",
  "Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile\nearth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a\nstrange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean\nsurrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one\ninsular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the\nhorrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that\nisle, thou canst never return!",
  "Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her\nway north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling\nher keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering\nmasts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a\nplain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,\nalluring jet would be seen.",
  "But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural\nspread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when\nthe long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid\nacross them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered\ntogether as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible\nsphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.",
  "In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and\nhigher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before\nour prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening\nfor a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose,\nand silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?\nthought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once\nmore, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod,\nthe negro yelled outThere! there again! there she breaches! right\nahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!",
  "Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the\nbees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on\nthe bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave\nhis orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction\nindicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.",
  "Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had\ngradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the\nideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular\nwhale he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed\nhim; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly\nperceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave\norders for lowering.",
  "The four boats were soon on the water; Ahabs in advance, and all\nswiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with\noars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot\nwhere it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the\nmoment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous\nphenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A\nvast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing\ncream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms\nradiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of\nanacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.\nNo perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of\neither sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an\nunearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.",
  "Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected\nwith the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it\nbeing so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with\nportentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them\ndeclare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few\nof them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature\nand form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm\nwhale his only food. For though other species of whales find their food\nabove water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the\nspermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the\nsurface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what,\nprecisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will\ndisgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some\nof them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They\nfancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings\nby them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other\nspecies, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.",
  "There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop\nPontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in\nwhich the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with\nsome other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But\nmuch abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he\nassigns it.",
  "The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly\nvapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary\nropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable\nto the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to\nthe sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary\nquantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which\nit must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in\ngeneral by no means adds to the ropes durability or strength, however\nmuch it may give it compactness and gloss.",
  "Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\nentirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not\nso durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and\nI will add (since there is an sthetics in all things), is much more\nhandsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark\nfellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian\nto behold.",
  "The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first\nsight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment\nits one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and\ntwenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal\nto three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures\nsomething over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is\nspirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still\nthough, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely\nbedded sheaves, or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any\nhollow but the heart, or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of\nthe cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in\nrunning out, infallibly take somebodys arm, leg, or entire body off,\nthe utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some\nharpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,\ncarrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a\nblock towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all\npossible wrinkles and twists.",
  "In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\nbeing continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in\nthis; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into\nthe boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,\nnearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a\nrather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in\nthickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which\nwill bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a\nconcentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the\nAmerican line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a\nprodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.",
  "Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an\neye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the\ntub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.\nThis arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:\nIn order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a\nneighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to\nthreaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the\nharpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug\nof ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first\nboat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This\narrangement is indispensable for common safetys sake; for were the\nlower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the\nwhale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking\nminute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed\nboat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of\nthe sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.",
  "Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\ntaken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is\nagain carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise\nupon the loom or handle of every mans oar, so that it jogs against his\nwrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately\nsit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the\nextreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size\nof a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it\nhangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the\nboat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being\ncoiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale\nstill a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warpthe\nrope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to\nthat connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too\ntedious to detail.",
  "Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\ntwisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the\noarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid\neye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest\nsnakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal\nwoman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,\nand while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any\nunknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible\ncontortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus\ncircumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones\nto quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habitstrange thing! what\ncannot habit accomplish?Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,\nand brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you\nwill hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus\nhung in hangmans nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before\nKing Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of\ndeath, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.",
  "Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those\nrepeated whaling disasterssome few of which are casually chronicledof\nthis man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.\nFor, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is\nlike being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a\nsteam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and\nwheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in\nthe heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle,\nand you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest\nwarning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and\nsimultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a\nMazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could\nnever pierce you out.",
  "Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and\nprophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;\nfor, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and\ncontains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal\npowder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the\nline, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought\ninto actual playthis is a thing which carries more of true terror than\nany other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men\nlive enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their\nnecks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,\nthat mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\nAnd if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would\nnot at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before\nyour evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.",
  "The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special\nto engage them, the Pequods crew could hardly resist the spell of\nsleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean\nthrough which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively\nground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins,\nflying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than\nthose off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.",
  "It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders\nleaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed\nin what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in\nthat dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of\nmy body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will,\nlong after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.",
  "Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the\nseamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that\nat last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every\nswing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering\nhelmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the\nwide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.",
  "Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my\nhands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved\nme; with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not\nforty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like\nthe capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian\nhue, glistening in the suns rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating\nin the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his\nvapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of\na warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck\nby some enchanters wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all\nat once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from\nall parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from\naloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and\nregularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.",
  "The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and\nere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the\nleeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples\nas he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,\nAhab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak\nbut in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the\nboats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of\nthe noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,\nthe monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,\nand then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.",
  "There go flukes! was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by\nStubbs producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite\nwas granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the\nwhale rose again, and being now in advance of the smokers boat, and\nmuch nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the\nhonor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length\nbecome aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore\nno longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.\nAnd still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the\nassault.",
  "*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the\nentire interior of the sperm whales enormous head consists. Though\napparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about\nhim. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does\nso when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the\nupper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water\nformation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he\nthereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish\ngalliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.",
  "Start her, start her, my men! Dont hurry yourselves; take plenty of\ntimebut start her; start her like thunder-claps, thats all, cried\nStubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. Start her, now; give em\nthe long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boystart\nher, all; but keep cool, keep coolcucumbers is the wordeasy,\neasyonly start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the\nburied dead perpendicular out of their graves, boysthats all. Start\nher!",
  "Ka-la! Koo-loo! howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a\nmouthful of Grenadiers steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels\ncut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still\nencouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from\nhis mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the\nwelcome cry was heardStand up, Tashtego!give it to him! The harpoon\nwas hurled. Stern all! The oarsmen backed water; the same moment\nsomething went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was\nthe magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two\nadditional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its\nincreased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and\nmingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round\nand round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it\nblisteringly passed through and through both of Stubbs hands, from\nwhich the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at\nthese times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemys\nsharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time\nstriving to wrest it out of your clutch.",
  "Wet the line! wet the line! cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him\nseated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into\nit.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.\nThe boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.\nStubb and Tashtego here changed placesstem for sterna staggering\nbusiness truly in that rocking commotion.",
  "*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be\nstated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the\nrunning line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or\nbailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most\nconvenient.",
  "From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part\nof the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you\nwould have thought the craft had two keelsone cleaving the water, the\nother the airas the boat churned on through both opposing elements at\nonce. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy\nin her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a\nlittle finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic\ngunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main\nclinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall\nform of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order\nto bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics\nseemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale\nsomewhat slackened his flight.",
  "Haul inhaul in! cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round\ntowards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while\nyet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb,\nfirmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart\ninto the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately\nsterning out of the way of the whales horrible wallow, and then\nranging up for another fling.",
  "The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down\na hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which\nbubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun\nplaying upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection\ninto every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men.\nAnd all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot\nfrom the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the\nmouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his\ncrooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again\nand again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and\nagain sent it into the whale.",
  "Pull uppull up! he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale\nrelaxed in his wrath. Pull up!close to! and the boat ranged along\nthe fishs flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned\nhis long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully\nchurning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold\nwatch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of\nbreaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was\nthe innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting\nfrom his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry, the\nmonster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in\nimpenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft,\ninstantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from\nthat phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.",
  "And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into\nview; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting\nhis spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last,\ngush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees\nof red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran\ndripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!",
  "According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes\noff from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary\nsteersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost\noar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong,\nnervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what\nis called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the\ndistance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting\nthe chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the\nuttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman\nactivity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated\nloud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the\ntop of ones compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half\nstartedwhat that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I\ncannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same\ntime. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the\nfish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting\ncryStand up, and give it to him! He now has to drop and secure his\noar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the\ncrotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it\nsomehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen\nin a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are\nsuccessful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed\nand disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their\nblood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are\nabsent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship\nowners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that\nmakes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can\nyou expect to find it there when most wanted!",
  "Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\nthat is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer\nlikewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of\nthemselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the\nheadsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper\nstation in the bows of the boat.",
  "Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both\nfoolish and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from\nfirst to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no\nrowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances\nobvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a\nslight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various\nwhalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast\nmajority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so\nmuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the\nharpooneer that has caused them.",
  "The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.\nIt is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length,\nwhich is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the\nbow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of\nthe harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the\nprow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who\nsnatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his\nrifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in\nthe crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.",
  "But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with\nthe line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one\ninstantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the\ncoming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It\nis a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to\nthe instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon\nreceiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer,\nhowever lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into\nhim. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the\nline, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,\nbe anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else\nthe most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the\nwater, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line\n(mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances,\nprudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended\nwith the saddest and most fatal casualties.",
  "Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown\noverboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,\nskittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines,\nor cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.\nNor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is\nfairly captured and a corpse.",
  "Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging\none unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these\nqualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of\nsuch an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be\nsimultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is\nsupplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first\none be ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are\nfaithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several\nmost important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be\npainted.",
  "Stubbs whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a\ncalm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow\nbusiness of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen\nmen with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\nfingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse\nin the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long\nintervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of\nthe mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever\nthey call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will\ndraw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this\ngrand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead\nin bulk.",
  "Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequods\nmain-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\ndropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly\neyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for\nsecuring it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,\nwent his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until\nmorning.",
  "Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\nevinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the\ncreature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or\ndespair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body\nreminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand\nother whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot\nadvance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought\nfrom the sound on the Pequods decks, that all hands were preparing to\ncast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the\ndeck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking\nlinks, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by\nthe head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies\nwith its black hull close to the vessels and seen through the darkness\nof the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the twoship\nand whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one\nreclines while the other remains standing.*",
  "*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most\nreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,\nis by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is\nrelatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its\nflexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;\nso that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to\nput the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a\nsmall, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,\nand a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.\nBy adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side\nof the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily\nmade to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last\nlocked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of\njunction with its broad flukes or lobes.",
  "If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known\non deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an\nunusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was\nhe in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned\nto him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping\ncause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely\nmanifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of\nthe whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.",
  "Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general\nthing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray\nthe current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds\nof the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers\nwho have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale\ndesignated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.",
  "About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two\nlanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper\nat the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb\nthe only banqueter on whales flesh that night. Mingling their\nmumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,\nswarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.\nThe few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp\nslapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the\nsleepers hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as\nbefore you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and\nturning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of\nthe whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the\nshark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable\nsurface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains\na part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave\non the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in\ncountersinking for a screw.",
  "Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks\nwill be seen longingly gazing up to the ships decks, like hungry dogs\nround a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every\nkilled man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant\nbutchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each others\nlive meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,\nalso, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away\nunder the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the\nwhole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing,\nthat is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties;\nand though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships\ncrossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy\nin case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be\ndecently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be\nset down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do\nmost socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no\nconceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless\nnumbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm\nwhale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen\nthat sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of\ndevil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.",
  "The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously\nroused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came\nshambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was\nsomething the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well\nscoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came\nshuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which,\nafter a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old\nEbony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of command, came\nto a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubbs sideboard; when, with\nboth hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he\nbowed his arched back still further over, at the same time sideways\ninclining his head, so as to bring his best ear into play.",
  "Cook, said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his\nmouth, dont you think this steak is rather overdone? Youve been\nbeating this steak too much, cook; its too tender. Dont I always say\nthat to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks\nnow over the side, dont you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a\nshindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to em; tell em they are\nwelcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must\nkeep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and\ndeliver my message. Here, take this lantern, snatching one from his\nsideboard; now then, go and preach to em!",
  "Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck\nto the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over\nthe sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other\nhand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in\na mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly\ncrawling behind, overheard all that was said.",
  "Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I dont blame ye so much for; dat\nis natur, and cant be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is\nde pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why\nden you be angel; for all angel is noting more dan de shark well\ngoberned. Now, look here, bredren, just try wonst to be cibil, a\nhelping yourselbs from dat whale. Dont be tearin de blubber out your\nneighbours mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat\nwhale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale\nbelong to some one else. I know some o you has berry brig mout,\nbrigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small\nbellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid, but to\nbit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat cant get into de\nscrouge to help demselves.",
  "No use goin on; de dam willains will keep a scougin and slappin\neach oder, Massa Stubb; dey dont hear one word; no use a-preachin to\nsuch dam guttons as you call em, till dare bellies is full, and dare\nbellies is bottomless; and when dey do get em full, dey wont hear you\nden; for den dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de coral, and\ncant hear noting at all, no more, for eber and eber.",
  "And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,\nwhere you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as\nhis beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here,\nand tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh? said Stubb.\nWhere do you expect to go to, cook?",
  "You said up there, didnt you? and now look yourself, and see where\nyour tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by\ncrawling through the lubbers hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you dont\nget there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. Its a\nticklish business, but must be done, or else its no go. But none of us\nare in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye\nhear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap tother atop of your heart,\nwhen Im giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?thats\nyour gizzard! Aloft! aloft!thats itnow you have it. Hold it there\nnow, and pay attention.",
  "Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,\nthat I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,\ndont you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for\nmy private table here, the capstan, Ill tell you what to do so as not\nto spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live\ncoal to it with the other; that done, dish it; dye hear? And now\nto-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by\nto get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends\nof the flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go.",
  "It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\nWhale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\nprices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIths time, a certain cook of the\ncourt obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be\neaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of\nwhale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The\nmeat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being\nwell seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.\nThe old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great\nporpoise grant from the crown.",
  "The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\nhands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\nwhen you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\nlong, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men\nlike Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are\nnot so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare\nold vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous\ndoctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly\njuicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who\nlong ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vesselthat\nthese men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\nwhales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among\nthe Dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters; which, indeed,\nthey greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something\nlike old Amsterdam housewives dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.\nThey have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can\nhardly keep his hands off.",
  "But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\nexceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be\ndelicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the\nbuffalos (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid\npyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that\nis; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the\nthird month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\nbutter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into\nsome other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches\nof the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their\nship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many\na good supper have I thus made.",
  "In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine\ndish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two\nplump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large\npuddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most\ndelectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves head, which is\nquite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young\nbucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves brains, by\nand by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to\ntell a calfs head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires\nuncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with\nan intelligent looking calfs head before him, is somehow one of the\nsaddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at\nhim, with an Et tu Brute! expression.",
  "It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively\nunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with\nabhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration\nbefore mentioned: _i.e._ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing\nof the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man\nthat ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was\nhung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would\nhave been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the\nmeat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds\nstaring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight\ntake a tooth out of the cannibals jaw? Cannibals? who is not a\ncannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that\nsalted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it\nwill be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of\njudgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who\nnailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy\npat-de-foie-gras.",
  "But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is\nadding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is\nthat handle made of?what but the bones of the brother of the very ox\nyou are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring\nthat fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill\ndid the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to\nGanders formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month\nor two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but\nsteel pens.",
  "When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and\nweary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general\nthing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting\nhim in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very\nsoon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the\ncommon usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm alee; and then send\nevery one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation\nthat, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and\ntwo for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck\nto see that all goes well.",
  "But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will\nnot answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather\nround the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a\nstretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In\nmost other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so\nlargely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably\ndiminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a\nprocedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to\ntickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the\npresent case with the Pequods sharks; though, to be sure, any man\nunaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,\nwould have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and\nthose sharks the maggots in it.",
  "Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was\nconcluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came\non deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for\nimmediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering\nthree lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid\nsea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an\nincessant murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep\ninto their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy\nconfusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not\nalways hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the\nincredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at\neach others disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and\nbit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again\nby the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was\nthis all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these\ncreatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in\ntheir very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual\nlife had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,\none of these sharks almost took poor Queequegs hand off, when he tried\nto shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.",
  "*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;\nis about the bigness of a mans spread hand; and in general shape,\ncorresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its\nsides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than\nthe lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when\nbeing used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a\nstiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.",
  "It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio\nprofessors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was\nturned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would\nhave thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.",
  "In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous\nthings comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and\nwhich no single man can possibly liftthis vast bunch of grapes was\nswayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the\nstrongest point anywhere above a ships deck. The end of the\nhawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted\nto the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over\nthe whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one\nhundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the\nside, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,\nbegan cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just\nabove the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad,\nsemicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the\nmain body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving\nin one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship\ncareens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads\nof an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her\nfrighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the\nwhale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a\nhelping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap\nis heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from\nthe whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it\nthe disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as\nthe blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,\nso is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes\nstripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the\nwindlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the\nwater, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the\nline called the scarf, simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck\nand Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and\nindeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher\nand higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the\nwindlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious\nblood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and\nevery one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else\nit may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.",
  "One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon\ncalled a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices\nout a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into\nthis hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then\nhooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for\nwhat follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands\nto stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a\nfew sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in\ntwain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper\nstrip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for\nlowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one\ntackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other\nis slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the\nmain hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the\nblubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep\ncoiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of\nplaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting\nand lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the\nheavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates\nscarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by\nway of assuaging the general friction.",
  "Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any\ncreatures skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet\nin point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;\nbecause you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the\nwhales body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer\nof any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?\nTrue, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with\nyour hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat\nresembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as\nflexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it\nnot only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I\nhave several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books.\nIt is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed\npage, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a\nmagnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales\nthrough their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at\nhere is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I\nadmit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be\nregarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to\nspeak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of\nthe tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a\nnew-born child. But no more of this.",
  "Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,\nas in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one\nhundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity,\nor rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three\nfourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence\nbe had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose\nmere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten\nbarrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three\nquarters of the stuff of the whales skin.",
  "In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among\nthe many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over\nobliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in\nthick array, something like those in the finest Italian line\nengravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the\nisinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as\nif they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some\ninstances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a\nveritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations.\nThese are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers\non the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to\nuse in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the\nhieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck\nwith a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the\nfamous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi.\nLike those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains\nundecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another\nthing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm\nWhale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially\nhis flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by\nreason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random\naspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,\nwhich Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact\nwith vast floating icebergsI should say, that those rocks must not a\nlittle resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me\nthat such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact\nwith other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,\nfull-grown bulls of the species.",
  "A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the\nwhale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long\npieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very\nhappy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber\nas in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho\nslipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of\nthis cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep\nhimself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.\nWhat would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy\nseas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other\nfish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but\nthese, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very\nbellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the\nlee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn\nfire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his\nblood, and he dies. How wonderful is it thenexcept after\nexplanationthat this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as\nindispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at\nhome, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when\nseamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,\nperpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is\nfound glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been\nproved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than\nthat of a Borneo negro in summer.",
  "It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong\nindividual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare\nvirtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself\nafter the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too,\nlive in this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep\nthy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peters, and\nlike the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of\nthine own.",
  "The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the\nbeheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue,\nit has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal.\nSlowly it floats more and more away, the water round it torn and\nsplashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with\nrapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many\ninsulting poniards in the whale. The vast white headless phantom floats\nfurther and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats,\nwhat seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the\nmurderous din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that\nhideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon\nthe fair face of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that\ngreat mass of death floats on and on, till lost in infinite\nperspectives.",
  "Theres a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all\nin pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or\nspeckled. In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween,\nif peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral\nthey most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from\nwhich not the mightiest whale is free.",
  "Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost\nsurvives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war\nor blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring\nthe swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in\nthe sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the\nwhales unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the\nlog_shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware!_ And for years\nafterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly\nsheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there\nwhen a stick was held. Theres your law of precedents; theres your\nutility of traditions; theres the story of your obstinate survival of\nold beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in\nthe air! Theres orthodoxy!",
  "Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;\non the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that\nvery place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the\nsurgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening\nbetween him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a\ndiscoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear\nin mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut\nmany feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without\nso much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus\nmade, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,\nand exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion\ninto the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubbs boast, that he\ndemanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?",
  "When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a\ncable till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small\nwhale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a\nfull grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whales head\nembraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend\nsuch a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this\nwere as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers\nscales.",
  "The Pequods whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head\nwas hoisted against the ships sideabout half way out of the sea, so\nthat it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And\nthere with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of\nthe enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm\non that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that\nblood-dripping head hung to the Pequods waist like the giant\nHoloferness from the girdle of Judith.",
  "A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone\nfrom his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to\ngaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took\nStubbs long spadestill remaining there after the whales\ndecapitationand striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended\nmass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood\nleaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.",
  "It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so\nintense a calm, it seemed the Sphynxs in the desert. Speak, thou vast\nand venerable head, muttered Ahab, which, though ungarnished with a\nbeard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty\nhead, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou\nhast dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams,\nhas moved amid this worlds foundations. Where unrecorded names and\nnavies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous\nhold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the\ndrowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar\nhome. Thou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many\na sailors side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay\nthem down. Thou sawst the locked lovers when leaping from their\nflaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true\nto each other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou sawst the\nmurdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours\nhe fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his\nmurderers still sailed on unharmedwhile swift lightnings shivered the\nneighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to\noutstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen enough to split the\nplanets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!",
  "Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way,\nand to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man!\nhow far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the\nsmallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate\nin mind.",
  "By and by, through the glass the strangers boats and manned mast-heads\nproved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and\nshooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the\nPequod could not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what\nresponse would be made.",
  "Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships\nof the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which\nsignals being collected in a book with the names of the respective\nvessels attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale\ncommanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at\nconsiderable distances and with no small facility.",
  "The Pequods signal was at last responded to by the strangers setting\nher own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket.\nSquaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequods lee,\nand lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was\nbeing rigged by Starbucks order to accommodate the visiting captain,\nthe stranger in question waved his hand from his boats stern in token\nof that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the\nJeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her\ncaptain, was fearful of infecting the Pequods company. For, though\nhimself and boats crew remained untainted, and though his ship was\nhalf a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and\nflowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine\nof the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with\nthe Pequod.",
  "But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an\ninterval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboams\nboat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to\nthe Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it\nblew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times\nby the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed\nsome way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper\nbearings again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now\nand then, a conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at\nintervals not without still another interruption of a very different\nsort.",
  "Pulling an oar in the Jeroboams boat, was a man of a singular\nappearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual\nnotabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish\nman, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant\nyellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut\ntinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on\nhis wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.",
  "So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had\nexclaimedThats he! thats he!the long-togged scaramouch the\nTown-Hos company told us of! Stubb here alluded to a strange story\ntold of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time\nprevious when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account\nand what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in\nquestion had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the\nJeroboam. His story was this:",
  "He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna\nShakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret\nmeetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a\ntrap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he\ncarried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing\ngunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange,\napostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket,\nwhere, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,\ncommon-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate\nfor the Jeroboams whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway\nupon the ships getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in\na freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded\nthe captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he\nset himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and\nvicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which\nhe declared these things;the dark, daring play of his sleepless,\nexcited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real\ndelirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of\nthe ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they\nwere afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical\nuse in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he\npleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but\napprised that that individuals intention was to land him in the first\nconvenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and\nvialsdevoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in\ncase this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his\ndisciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the\ncaptain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of\nthem would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor\nwould they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he\nwould; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of\nthe ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared\nlittle or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had\nbroken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the\nplague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be\nstayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor\ndevils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to\nhis instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.\nSuch things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.\nNor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the\nmeasureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless\npower of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to\nreturn to the Pequod.",
  "I tell thee again, Gabriel, that But again the boat tore ahead as if\ndragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a\nsuccession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional\ncaprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the\nhoisted sperm whales head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was\nseen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel\nnature seemed to warrant.",
  "It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking\na whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of\nMoby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this\nintelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the\nWhite Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering\ninsanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the\nShaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some\nyear or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the\nmast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him;\nand the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\nopportunity, despite all the archangels denunciations and\nforewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.\nWith them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\nperilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron\nfast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was\ntossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of\nspeedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while\nMacey, the mate, was standing up in his boats bow, and with all the\nreckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the\nwhale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a\nbroad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,\ntemporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next\ninstant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily\ninto the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea\nat the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was\nharmed, nor a hair of any oarsmans head; but the mate for ever sank.",
  "It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\nSperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\nSometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\noftener the boats bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the\nheadsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But\nstrangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,\nwhen the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is\ndiscernible; the man being stark dead.",
  "The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly\ndescried from the ship. Raising a piercing shriekThe vial! the vial!\nGabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of\nthe whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added\ninfluence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had\nspecifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general\nprophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one\nof many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror\nto the ship.",
  "Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,\nthat the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he\nintended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which\nAhab answeredAye. Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to\nhis feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with\ndownward pointed fingerThink, think of the blasphemerdead, and down\nthere!beware of the blasphemers end!",
  "Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various\nships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,\ndepends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.\nThus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received\nafter attaining an age of two or three years or more.",
  "Canst not read it? cried Ahab. Give it me, man. Aye, aye, its but\na dim scrawl;whats this? As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a\nlong cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to\ninsert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without\nits coming any closer to the ship.",
  "Curses throttle thee! yelled Ahab. Captain Mayhew, stand by now to\nreceive it; and taking the fatal missive from Starbucks hands, he\ncaught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the\nboat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing;\nthe boat drifted a little towards the ships stern; so that, as if by\nmagic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriels eager hand. He\nclutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the\nletter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahabs\nfeet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their\noars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the\nPequod.",
  "In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,\nthere is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands\nare wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no\nstaying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has\nto be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the\ndescription of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was\nmentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whales back, the\nblubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the\nspades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that\nsame hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my\nparticular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to\ndescend upon the monsters back for the special purpose referred to.\nBut in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall\nremain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is\nconcluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,\nexcepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten\nfeet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,\nhalf on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like\na tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured\nin the Highland costumea shirt and socksin which to my eyes, at\nleast, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better\nchance to observe him, as will presently be seen.",
  "Being the savages bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar\nin his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to\nattend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead\nwhales back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by\na long cord. Just so, from the ships steep side, did I hold Queequeg\ndown there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a\nmonkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his\nwaist.",
  "It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\nproceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both\nends; fast to Queequegs broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow\nleather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,\nwere wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both\nusage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should\ndrag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature\nunited us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I\nany way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond\nentailed.",
  "So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,\nthat while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to\nperceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock\ncompany of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that\nanothers mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited\ndisaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of\ninterregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have\nso gross an injustice. And yet still further ponderingwhile I jerked\nhim now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten\nto jam himstill further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of\nmine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in\nmost cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a\nplurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your\napothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True,\nyou may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these\nand the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequegs\nmonkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I\ncame very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do\nwhat I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*",
  "*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod\nthat the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This\nimprovement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man\nthan Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest\npossible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his\nmonkey-rope holder.",
  "I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the\nwhale and the shipwhere he would occasionally fall, from the incessant\nrolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy\nhe was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the\nnight, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before\npent blood which began to flow from the carcassthe rabid creatures\nswarmed round it like bees in a beehive.",
  "Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a\nravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to\nthem. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then\njerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what\nseemed a peculiarly ferocious sharkhe was provided with still another\nprotection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and\nDaggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen\nwhale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\nreach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and\nbenevolent of them. They meant Queequegs best happiness, I admit; but\nin their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that\nboth he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled\nwater, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a\nleg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping\nthere with that great iron hookpoor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed\nto his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.",
  "Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in\nand then slacked off the rope to every swell of the seawhat matters\nit, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men\nin this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those\nsharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks\nand spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.",
  "But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now,\nas with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last\nclimbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily\ntrembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,\nconsolatory glance hands himwhat? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye\ngods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!",
  "Ginger? Do I smell ginger? suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.\nYes, this must be ginger, peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then\nstanding as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the\nastonished steward slowly saying, Ginger? ginger? and will you have\nthe goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of\nginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to\nkindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!what the devil is\nginger? Sea-coal? firewood?lucifer matches?tinder?gunpowder?what\nthe devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor\nQueequeg here.",
  "There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this\nbusiness, he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just\ncome from forward. Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it,\nif you please. Then watching the mates countenance, he added, The\nsteward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to\nQueequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an\napothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by\nwhich he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?",
  "It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whales\nprodigious head hanging to the Pequods side. But we must let it\ncontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to\nit. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for\nthe head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.",
  "Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually\ndrifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,\ngave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the\nLeviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking\nanywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of\nthose inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to\ncruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near\nthe Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had\nbeen brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the\nannouncement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day,\nif opportunity offered.",
  "Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two\nboats, Stubbs and Flasks, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further\nand further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at\nthe mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of\ntumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or\nboth the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in\nplain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the\ntowing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first\nit seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a\nmaelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from\nview, as if diving under the keel. Cut, cut! was the cry from the\nship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being\nbrought with a deadly dash against the vessels side. But having plenty\nof line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they\npaid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their\nmight so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle\nwas intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened\nline in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the\ncontending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few\nfeet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did\ngain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning\nalong the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,\nsuddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so\nflinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken\nglass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once\nmore the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,\nand blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship\ntowing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete\ncircuit.",
  "Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close\nflanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance;\nand thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the\nmultitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whales body,\nrushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every\nnew gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains\nthat poured from the smitten rock.",
  "Wants with it? said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boats bow,\ndid you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whales\nhead hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right\nWhales on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can\nnever afterwards capsize?",
  "I dont know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so,\nand he seems to know all about ships charms. But I sometimes think\nhell charm the ship to no good at last. I dont half like that chap,\nStubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved\ninto a snakes head, Stubb?",
  "Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a\ndark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look\ndown there, Flaskpointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both\nhandsAye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in\ndisguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been\nstowed away on board ship? Hes the devil, I say. The reason why you\ndont see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries\nit coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of\nit, hes always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.",
  "I dont know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked\none, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old\nflag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and\ngentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he\nwas at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching\nhis hoofs, up and says, I want John. What for? says the old\ngovernor. What business is that of yours, says the devil, getting\nmad,I want to use him. Take him, says the governorand by the\nLord, Flask, if the devil didnt give John the Asiatic cholera before\nhe got through with him, Ill eat this whale in one mouthful. But look\nsharpaint you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and lets get\nthe whale alongside.",
  "Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesnt the devil live\nfor ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any\nparson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a\nlatch-key to get into the admirals cabin, dont you suppose he can\ncrawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?",
  "Do you see that mainmast there? pointing to the ship; well, thats\nthe figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequods hold, and string\nalong in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that\nwouldnt begin to be Fedallahs age. Nor all the coopers in creation\ncouldnt show hoops enough to make oughts enough.",
  "But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you\nmeant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if\nhes so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to\nlive for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboardtell me\nthat?",
  "I should like to see him try it; Id give him such a pair of black\neyes that he wouldnt dare to show his face in the admirals cabin\nagain for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he\nlives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn\nthe devil, Flask; so you suppose Im afraid of the devil? Whos afraid\nof him, except the old governor who daresnt catch him and put him in\ndouble-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping\npeople; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil\nkidnapped, hed roast for him? Theres a governor!",
  "Do I suppose it? Youll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now\nto keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious\ngoing on, Ill just take him by the nape of his neck, and sayLook\nhere, Beelzebub, you dont do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord\nIll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,\nand give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come\nshort off at the stumpdo you see; and then, I rather guess when he\nfinds himself docked in that queer fashion, hell sneak off without the\npoor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.",
  "In good time, Flasks saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply\nleaned over towards the sperm whales head, now, by the counterpoise of\nboth heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may\nwell believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Lockes head, you go\nover that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kants and you come\nback again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep\ntrimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,\nand then you will float light and right.",
  "In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the\nship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the\ncase of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut\noff whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed\nand hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to\nwhat is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present\ncase, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern;\nand the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair\nof overburdening panniers.",
  "Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whales head, and ever\nand anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own\nhand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his\nshadow; while, if the Parsees shadow was there at all it seemed only\nto blend with, and lengthen Ahabs. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish\nspeculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing\nthings.",
  "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\nWhale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales\nregularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two\nextremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external\ndifference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\nhead of each is this moment hanging from the Pequods side; and as we\nmay freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\ndeck:where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to\nstudy practical cetology than here?",
  "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\nthese heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a\ncertain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whales which the Right\nWhales sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whales head.\nAs you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to\nhim, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this\ndignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the\nsummit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he\nis what the fishermen technically call a grey-headed whale.",
  "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these headsnamely, the two\nmost important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the\nhead, and low down, near the angle of either whales jaw, if you\nnarrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\nfancy to be a young colts eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\nmagnitude of the head.",
  "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whales eyes, it is\nplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\nthan he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whales\neyes corresponds to that of a mans ears; and you may fancy, for\nyourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\nthrough your ears. You would find that you could only command some\nthirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\nand about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\nstraight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\nbe able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\nbehind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\nsame time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes\nthe front of a manwhat, indeed, but his eyes?",
  "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\nare so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\nproduce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\nthe whales eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\nsolid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\ntwo lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\nimpressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\nmust see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\npicture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\nnothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\nworld from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with\nthe whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two\ndistinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the\nwhales eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and\nto be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.",
  "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\nvisual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\nhint. So long as a mans eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\nis involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\nwhatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any ones experience\nwill teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\nthings at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and\ncompletely, to examine any two thingshowever large or however smallat\none and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side\nand touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\nobjects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\norder to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\nbear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\nconsciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in\nthemselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\ncomprehensive, combining, and subtle than mans, that he can at the\nsame moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on\none side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he\ncan, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\nsimultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\nproblems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\nincongruity in this comparison.",
  "It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\nextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\nbeset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\nfrights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\nproceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\ndivided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.",
  "But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an\nentire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for\nhours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf\nwhatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\nwondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\nrespect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\nbetween the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has\nan external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered\nover with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.",
  "Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the\nworld through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear\nwhich is smaller than a hares? But if his eyes were broad as the lens\nof Herschels great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of\ncathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of\nhearing? Not at all.Why then do you try to enlarge your mind?\nSubtilize it.",
  "Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant\nover the sperm whales head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending\nby a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not\nthat the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we\nmight descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But\nlet us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What\na really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,\nlined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as\nbridal satins.",
  "But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems\nlike the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one\nend, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,\nand expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,\nalas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these\nspikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,\nwhen fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there\nsuspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging\nstraight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a\nships jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\nsorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his\njaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a\nreproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon\nhim.",
  "In most cases this lower jawbeing easily unhinged by a practised\nartistis disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting\nthe ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone\nwith which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,\nincluding canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.",
  "With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an\nanchor; and when the proper time comessome few days after the other\nworkQueequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists,\nare set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances\nthe gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being\nrigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag\nstumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally\nforty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed;\nnor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn\ninto slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.",
  "As in general shape the noble Sperm Whales head may be compared to a\nRoman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly\nrounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whales head bears a rather\ninelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred\nyears ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a\nshoemakers last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the\nnursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be\nlodged, she and all her progeny.",
  "But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\naspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit\nand look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole\nhead for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in\nits sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,\ncrested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the massthis green,\nbarnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the crown, and the\nSouthern fishers the bonnet of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes\nsolely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,\nwith a birds nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those\nlive crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost\nsure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the\ntechnical term crown also bestowed upon it; in which case you will\ntake great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a\ndiademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for\nhim in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a\nvery sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower\nlip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by\ncarpenters measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a\nsulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.",
  "A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.\nThe fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an\nimportant interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when\nearthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery\nthreshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at\nMackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good\nLord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet\nhigh, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular\nridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us\nwith those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone,\nsay three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the\nhead or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere\nbeen cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with\nhairy fibres, through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in\nwhose intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes\nthrough the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of\nbone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious\nmarks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the\ncreatures age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the\ncertainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the\nsavor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we\nmust grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance\nwill seem reasonable.",
  "In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\nconcerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous\nwhiskers inside of the whales mouth;* another, hogs bristles; a\nthird old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:\nThere are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his\nupper _chop_, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.",
  "As every one knows, these same hogs bristles, fins, whiskers,\nblinds, or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and\nother stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has\nlong been on the decline. It was in Queen Annes time that the bone was\nin its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those\nancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as\nyou may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we\nnowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a\ntent spread over the same bone.",
  "But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,\nstanding in the Right Whales mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all\nthese colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not\nthink you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its\nthousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest\nTurkeythe tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the\nmouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting\nit on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I\nshould say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that\namount of oil.",
  "Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started\nwiththat the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely\ndifferent heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whales there is no\ngreat well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible\nof a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whales. Nor in the Sperm Whale are\nthere any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely\nanything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external\nspout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.",
  "Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whales there? It is the same\nhe died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now\nfaded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like\nplacidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the\nother heads expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by\naccident against the vessels side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw.\nDoes not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical\nresolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a\nStoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in\nhis latter years.",
  "Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whales head, I would have you,\nas a sensible physiologist, simplyparticularly remark its front\naspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you\ninvestigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some\nunexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may\nbe lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must either\nsatisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an\ninfidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events,\nperhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.",
  "You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,\nthe front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the\nwater; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes\nconsiderably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long\nsocket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the\nmouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as\nthough your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you\nobserve that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he\nhashis spout holeis on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes\nand ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire\nlength from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the\nfront of the Sperm Whales head is a dead, blind wall, without a single\norgan or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are\nnow to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part\nof the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and\nnot till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the\nfull cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is\nas one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents\npartly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised\nof the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that\napparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how\nthe blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.\nJust so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this\nenvelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable\nby any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the\nsharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds\nfrom it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved\nwith horses hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.",
  "Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen\nchance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the\nsailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming\ncontact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold\nthere a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and\ntoughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which\nwould have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By\nitself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But\nsupplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as\nordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,\ncapable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,\nas far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the\notherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head\naltogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated\nout of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its\nenvelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has\nhypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled\nhoneycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and\nunsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to\natmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the\nirresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and\ndestructive of all elements contributes.",
  "Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable\nwall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a\nmass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood\nisby the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest\ninsect. So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the\nspecialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this\nexpansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more\ninconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all\nignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the\nSperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed\nthe Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your\neye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and\nsentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for salamander\ngiants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials\nthen? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddesss veil\nat Lais?",
  "Regarding the Sperm Whales head as a solid oblong, you may, on an\ninclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower\nis the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an\nunctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the\nexpanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the\nforehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two\nalmost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal\nwall of a thick tendinous substance.",
  "*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical\nmathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a\nsolid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the\nsteep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both\nsides.",
  "The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of\noil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand\ninfiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole\nextent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great\nHeidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is\nmystically carved in front, so the whales vast plaited forehead forms\ninnumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his\nwondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished\nwith the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun\nof the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily\nvintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,\nlimpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found\nunalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains\nperfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon\nbegins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when\nthe first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whales\ncase generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from\nunavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and\ndribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish\nbusiness of securing what you can.",
  "It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale\nembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and sinceas\nhas been elsewhere set forththe head embraces one third of the whole\nlength of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet\nfor a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the\ndepth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a\nships side.",
  "As in decapitating the whale, the operators instrument is brought\nclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the\nspermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest\na careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly\nlet out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the\nhead, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in\nthat position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen\ncombinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that\nquarter.",
  "Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect\nposture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the\npart where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried\nwith him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,\ntravelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that\nit hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it\nis caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down\nthe other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he\nlands on the summit of the head. Therestill high elevated above the\nrest of the company, to whom he vivaciously crieshe seems some Turkish\nMuezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A\nshort-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches\nfor the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business\nhe proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,\nsounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time\nthis cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like\na well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the\nother end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or\nthree alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the\nIndian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.\nInserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the\nbucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word\nto the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like\na dairy-maids pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the\nfull-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly\nemptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through\nthe same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the\nend, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper\nand deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone\ndown.",
  "Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;\nseveral tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once\na queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild\nIndian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his\none-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or\nwhether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or\nwhether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without\nstating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling\nnow; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came\nsuckingly upmy God! poor Tashtegolike the twin reciprocating bucket\nin a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of\nHeidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of\nsight!",
  "Man overboard! cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first\ncame to his senses. Swing the bucket this way! and putting one foot\ninto it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip\nitself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost\nbefore Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there\nwas a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before\nlifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,\nas if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only\nthe poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous\ndepth to which he had sunk.",
  "At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing\nthe whipwhich had somehow got foul of the great cutting tacklesa\nsharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,\none of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a\nvast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship\nreeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,\nupon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be\non the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent\nmotions of the head.",
  "Come down, come down! yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand\nholding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he\nwould still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,\nrammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the\nburied harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.",
  "Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass\ndropped into the sea, like Niagaras Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the\nsuddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering\ncopper; and all caught their breath, as half swingingnow over the\nsailors heads, and now over the waterDaggoo, through a thick mist of\nspray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,\nburied-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the\nsea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked\nfigure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen\nhovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my\nbrave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the\nside, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,\nand no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands\nnow jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the\nship.",
  "Both! both!it is both!cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and\nsoon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and\nwith the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the\nwaiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was\nlong in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.",
  "Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the\nslowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side\nlunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then\ndropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,\nand so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first\nthrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that\nwas not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;he had\nthrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a\nsomerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in\nthe good old wayhead foremost. As for the great head itself, that was\ndoing as well as could be expected.",
  "And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\nQueequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was\nsuccessfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and\napparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be\nforgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing\nand boxing, riding and rowing.",
  "I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Headers will be sure to\nseem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have\neither seen or heard of some ones falling into a cistern ashore; an\naccident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than\nthe Indians, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the\nSperm Whales well.",
  "But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought\nthe tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and\nmost corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of\na far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at\nall, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had\nbeen nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the\ndense tendinous wall of the wella double welded, hammered substance,\nas I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of\nwhich sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking\nin this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted\nby the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it\nsank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair\nchance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.\nYes, it was a running delivery, so it was.",
  "Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious\nperishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant\nspermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber\nand sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be\nrecalledthe delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey\nin the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that\nleaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How\nmany, think ye, have likewise fallen into Platos honey head, and\nsweetly perished there?",
  "To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this\nLeviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has\nas yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as\nfor Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,\nor for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the\nPantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of\nthe various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of\nhorses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the\nmodifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his\ndisciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the\nphrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,\nthough I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of\nthese two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all\nthings; I achieve what I can.",
  "Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He\nhas no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most\nconspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and\nfinally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that\nits entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect\nthe countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,\ncupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable\nto the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in\nkeeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the\nnose from Phidiass marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!\nNevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his\nproportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the\nsculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is\nan added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As\non your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your\njolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the\nreflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which\nso often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest\nroyal beadle on his throne.",
  "In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the\nmorning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has\na touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,\nthe elephants brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is\nas that great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their\ndecrees. It signifiesGod: done this day by my hand. But in most\ncreatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip\nof alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which\nlike Shakespeares or Melancthons rise so high, and descend so low,\nthat the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;\nand all above them in the foreheads wrinkles, you seem to track the\nantlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters\ntrack the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this\nhigh and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\namplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the\nDeity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other\nobject in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one\ndistinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;\nhe has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a\nforehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats,\nand ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;\nthough that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In\nprofile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic\ndepression in the foreheads middle, which, in man, is Lavaters mark\nof genius.",
  "But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a\nbook, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing\nnothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his\npyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale\nbeen known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by\ntheir child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,\nbecause the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue,\nor at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of\nprotrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall\nlure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and\nlivingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now\nunhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Joves high seat, the great\nSperm Whale shall lord it.",
  "Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is\nno Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every mans and every beings\nface. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing\nfable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could\nnot read the simplest peasants face in its profounder and more subtle\nmeanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of\nthe Sperm Whales brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you\ncan.",
  "In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet\nin length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as\nthe side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level\nbase. But in lifeas we have elsewhere seenthis inclined plane is\nangularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent\nmass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to\nbed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this craterin\nanother cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in\ndepthreposes the mere handful of this monsters brain. The brain is at\nleast twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away\nbehind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the\namplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it\nsecreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny\nthat the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance\nof one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in\nstrange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it\nseems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that\nmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.",
  "It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in\nthe creatures living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his\ntrue brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The\nwhale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the\ncommon world.",
  "If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view\nof its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its\nresemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from\nthe same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down\nto the human magnitude) among a plate of mens skulls, and you would\ninvoluntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on\none part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would sayThis man\nhad no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,\nconsidered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and\npower, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most\nexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.",
  "But if from the comparative dimensions of the whales proper brain, you\ndeem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea\nfor you. If you attentively regard almost any quadrupeds spine, you\nwill be struck with the resemblance of its vertebr to a strung\nnecklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the\nskull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebr are absolutely\nundeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the\nGermans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once\npointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with\nthe vertebr of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the\nbeaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have\nomitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the\ncerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a mans\ncharacter will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel\nyour spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine\nnever yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in\nthe firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the\nworld.",
  "Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial\ncavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra\nthe bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being\neight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As\nit passes through the remaining vertebr the canal tapers in size, but\nfor a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,\nthis canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substancethe\nspinal cordas the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And\nwhat is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brains\ncavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal\nto that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be\nunreasonable to survey and map out the whales spine phrenologically?\nFor, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his\nbrain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative\nmagnitude of his spinal cord.",
  "But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\nwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the\nSperm Whales hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one\nof the larger vertebr, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer\nconvex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call\nthis high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm\nWhale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have\nreason to know.",
  "However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the\nwhale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old\nproverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing\nreally happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did\nindubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.",
  "As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all\nheeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German\nsoon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately\nturning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some\nremarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in\nprofound darknesshis last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a\nsingle flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by\nhinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically\ncalled a _clean_ one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name\nof Jungfrau or the Virgin.",
  "His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his\nships side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the\nmast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that\nwithout pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed\nround his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.",
  "Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German\nboats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the\nPequods keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their\ndanger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before\nthe wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in\nharness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling\na great wide parchment upon the sea.",
  "Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,\nhumped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as\nby the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed\nafflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this\nwhale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is\nnot customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.\nNevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water\nmust have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\nmuzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile\ncurrents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth\nwith a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds,\nfollowed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to\nhave egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind\nhim to upbubble.",
  "Whos got some paregoric? said Stubb, he has the stomach-ache, Im\nafraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse\nwinds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. Its the first foul wind\nI ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so\nbefore? it must be, hes lost his tiller.",
  "As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck\nload of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her\nway; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly\nturning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious\nwake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost\nthat fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.",
  "With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one\nfish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most\nvaluable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were\ngoing with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for\nthe time. At this juncture the Pequods keels had shot by the three\nGerman boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,\nDericks boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his\nforeign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being\nalready so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron\nbefore they could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he\nseemed quite confident that this would be the case, and occasionally\nwith a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.",
  "I tell ye what it is, mencried Stubb to his crewits against my\nreligion to get mad; but Id like to eat that villainous\nYarmanPullwont ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye\nlove brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why\ndont some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Whos that been dropping an\nanchor overboardwe dont budge an inchwere becalmed. Halloo, heres\ngrass growing in the boats bottomand by the Lord, the mast theres\nbudding. This wont do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long\nof it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?",
  "Oh! see the suds he makes! cried Flask, dancing up and downWhat a\nhumpOh, _do_ pile on the beeflays like a log!

  "Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequods\nthree boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,\nmomentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the\nheadsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up\nproudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating\ncry of, There she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down\nwith the Yarman! Sail over him!",
  "But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all\ntheir gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not\na righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the\nblade of his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to\nfree his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Dericks boat was nigh\nto capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;that\nwas a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took\na mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the Germans\nquarter. An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the\nwhales immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was\nthe foaming swell that he made.",
  "It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was\nnow going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual\ntormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of\nfright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering\nflight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank\nin the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So\nhave I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles\nin the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird\nhas a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the\nfear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted\nin him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his\nspiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while\nstill, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there\nwas enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.",
  "But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all\nthree tigersQueequeg, Tashtego, Daggooinstinctively sprang to their\nfeet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their\nbarbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three\nNantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and\nwhite-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whales headlong\nrush, bumped the Germans aside with such force, that both Derick and\nhis baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three\nflying keels.",
  "Dont be afraid, my butter-boxes, cried Stubb, casting a passing\nglance upon them as he shot by; yell be picked up presentlyall\nrightI saw some sharks asternSt. Bernards dogs, you knowrelieve\ndistressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel\na sunbeam! Hurrah!Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a\nmad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a\ntilbury on a plainmakes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to\nhim that way; and theres danger of being pitched out too, when you\nstrike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when hes going\nto Davy Jonesall a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this\nwhale carries the everlasting mail!",
  "But the monsters run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\ntumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round\nthe loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;\nwhile so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would\nsoon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they\ncaught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\nlastowing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of\nthe boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the bluethe\ngunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three\nsterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for\nsome time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more\nline, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have\nbeen taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this holding on, as\nit is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from\nthe back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising\nagain to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the\nperil of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always\nthe best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the\nstricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because,\nowing to the enormous surface of himin a full grown sperm whale\nsomething less than 2000 square feetthe pressure of the water is\nimmense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we\nourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how\nvast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two\nhundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty\natmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty\nline-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on\nboard.",
  "As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\ninto its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\nsort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;\nwhat landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and\nplacidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in\nagony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.\nSeems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan\nwas suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and\nto what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was\nonce so triumphantly saidCanst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?\nor his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him\ncannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron\nas straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;\nhe laugheth at the shaking of a spear! This the creature? this he? Oh!\nthat unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength of\na thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the\nmountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequods fish-spears!",
  "Stand by, men; he stirs, cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly\nvibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by\nmagnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every\noarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part\nfrom the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce\nupwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are\nscared from it into the sea.",
  "His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land\nanimals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,\nwhereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly\nshut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose\npeculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the\nblood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a\nharpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial\nsystem; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\nwater at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to\npour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of\nblood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that\nhe will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even\nas in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs\nof far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled\nupon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the\nlances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the\nnew made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural\nspout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending\nits affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet\ncame, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life,\nas they significantly call it, was untouched.",
  "As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\nhis form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\nrevealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were\nbeheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the\nnoblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whales eyes\nhad once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.\nBut pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his\nblind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light\nthe gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate\nthe solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to\nall. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a\nstrangely discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low\ndown on the flank.",
  "But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an\nulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\nthan sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift\nfury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying\ncrews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flasks boat and marring\nthe bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he\nby loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had\nmade; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,\nthen over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the\nwhite secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most\npiteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is\ngradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled\nmelancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the\ngroundso the last long dying spout of the whale.",
  "Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\nshowed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\nImmediately, by Starbucks orders, lines were secured to it at\ndifferent points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\nwhale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By very\nheedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred\nto her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest\nfluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the\nbody would at once sink to the bottom.",
  "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,\nthe entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his\nflesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the\nstumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured\nwhales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence\nof any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have\nbeen some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for\nthe ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a\nlance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,\nthe flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And\nwhen? It might have been darted by some Nor West Indian long before\nAmerica was discovered.",
  "What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\ncabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further\ndiscoveries, by the ships being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways\nto the sea, owing to the bodys immensely increasing tendency to sink.\nHowever, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to\nthe last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the\nship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with\nthe body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such\nwas the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the\nfluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast\nthem off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the\nother side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a\nhouse. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her\nbulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\ndislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the\nimmovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so\nlow had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at\nall approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed\nadded to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going\nover.",
  "Hold on, hold on, wont ye? cried Stubb to the body, dont be in\nsuch a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something\nor go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes,\nand run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big\nchains.",
  "Knife? Aye, aye, cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenters heavy\nhatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing\nat the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were\ngiven, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific\nsnap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.",
  "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\nWhale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\naccounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\nbuoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\nsurface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\nbroken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\nbones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that\nthis sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\nsinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it\nis not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with\nnoble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of\nlife, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny,\nbuoyant heroes do sometimes sink.",
  "Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\naccident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty\nRight Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable\nin no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;\nhis Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this\nincumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances\nwhere, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale\nagain rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is\nobvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious\nmagnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship\ncould hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings,\namong the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of\nsinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when\nthe body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall\nhave ascended again.",
  "It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from\nthe Pequods mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again\nlowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a\nFin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of\nits incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Backs spout is\nso similar to the Sperm Whales, that by unskilful fishermen it is\noften mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were\nnow in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all\nsail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared\nfar to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.",
  "The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up\nto the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its\ngreat honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many\ngreat demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other\nhave shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection\nthat I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a\nfraternity.",
  "The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to\nthe eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale\nattacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.\nThose were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms\nto succor the distressed, and not to fill mens lamp-feeders. Every one\nknows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely\nAndromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast,\nand as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the\nprince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and\ndelivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit,\nrarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as\nthis Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt\nthis Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian\ncoast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast\nskeleton of a whale, which the citys legends and all the inhabitants\nasserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.\nWhen the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in\ntriumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this\nstory, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.",
  "Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromedaindeed, by some supposed\nto be indirectly derived from itis that famous story of St. George and\nthe Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many\nold chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and\noften stand for each other. Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a\ndragon of the sea, saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in\ntruth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it\nwould much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but\nencountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle\nwith the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only\na Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march\nboldly up to a whale.",
  "Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the\ncreature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely\nrepresented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted\non land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance\nof those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;\nand considering that as in Perseus case, St. Georges whale might have\ncrawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal\nridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;\nbearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible\nwith the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to\nhold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself.\nIn fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story\nwill fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines,\nDagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horses\nhead and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the\nstump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble\nstamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by\ngood rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most\nnoble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that\nhonorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do\nwith a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer\nwith disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we\nare much better entitled to St. Georges decoration than they.",
  "Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long\nremained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that\nantique Crockett and Kit Carsonthat brawny doer of rejoicing good\ndeeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that\nstrictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere\nappears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from\nthe inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary\nwhaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I\nclaim him for one of our clan.",
  "Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole\nroll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like\nroyal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in\nnothing short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental\nstory is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread\nVishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives\nus this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;Vishnoo, who, by the first\nof his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified\nthe whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved\nto recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave\nbirth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical\nbooks, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo\nbefore beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained\nsomething in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these\nVedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became\nincarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,\nrescued the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even\nas a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?",
  "Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in\nthe preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this\nhistorical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some\nsceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans\nof their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale,\nand Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did\nnot make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.",
  "One old Sag-Harbor whalemans chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\nstory was this:He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\nembellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented\nJonahs whale with two spouts in his heada peculiarity only true with\nrespect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the\nvarieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this\nsaying, A penny roll would choke him; his swallow is so very small.\nBut, to this, Bishop Jebbs anticipative answer is ready. It is not\nnecessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the\nwhales belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And\nthis seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right\nWhales mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and\ncomfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have\nensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right\nWhale is toothless.",
  "Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\nwant of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in\nreference to his incarcerated body and the whales gastric juices. But\nthis objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist\nsupposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a\n_dead_ whaleeven as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned\ntheir dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has\nbeen divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was\nthrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his\nescape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a\nfigure-head; and, I would add, possibly called The Whale, as some\ncraft are nowadays christened the Shark, the Gull, the Eagle. Nor\nhave there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the\nwhale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserveran\ninflated bag of windwhich the endangered prophet swam to, and so was\nsaved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all\nround. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was\nthis, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the\nMediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere\nwithin three days journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much\nmore than three days journey across from the nearest point of the\nMediterranean coast. How is that?",
  "But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within\nthat short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by\nthe way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage\nthrough the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up\nthe Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the\ncomplete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of\nthe Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any\nwhale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonahs weathering the Cape of\nGood Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of\nthat great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and\nso make modern history a liar.",
  "But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his\nfoolish pride of reasona thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing\nthat he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the\nsun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and\nabominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a\nPortuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonahs going to Nineveh\nvia the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the\ngeneral miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly\nenlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah.\nAnd some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harriss\nVoyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which\nMosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.",
  "To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are\nanointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an\nanalogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it\nto be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly\nbe of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are\nhostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to\nmake the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing\nhis boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau\ndisappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;\ncrawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in\nthe unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair\nfrom the crafts bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to\nsome particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the\nevent.",
  "Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubbs was foremost. By great\nexertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the\nstricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal\nflight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the\nplanted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became\nimperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to\nhaul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and\nfurious. What then remained?",
  "Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and\ncountless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,\nnone exceed that fine manuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small\nsword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It\nis only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact\nand feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is\naccurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme\nheadway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or\ntwelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the\nharpoon, and also of a lighter materialpine. It is furnished with a\nsmall rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be\nhauled back to the hand after darting.",
  "But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though\nthe harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is\nseldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on\naccount of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as\ncompared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a\ngeneral thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before\nany pitchpoling comes into play.",
  "Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\nequanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel\nin pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the\nflying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet\nahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along\nits length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers\nup the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in\nhis grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full\nbefore his waistbands middle, he levels it at the whale; when,\ncovering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,\nthereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon\nhis palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,\nbalancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless\nimpulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming\ndistance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of\nsparkling water, he now spouts red blood.",
  "That drove the spigot out of him! cried Stubb. Tis Julys immortal\nFourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old\nOrleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,\nTashtego, lad, Id have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and wed drink\nround it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, wed brew choice punch in the\nspread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the\nliving stuff.",
  "Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,\nthe spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful\nleash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is\nslackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and\nmutely watches the monster die.",
  "That for six thousand yearsand no one knows how many millions of ages\nbeforethe great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and\nsprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many\nsprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,\nthousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the\nwhale, watching these sprinklings and spoutingsthat all this should\nbe, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter\nminutes past one oclock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.\n1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are,\nafter all, really water, or nothing but vaporthis is surely a\nnoteworthy thing.",
  "Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\ncontingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\ngills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\nis combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a\ncod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\nsurface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\nregular lungs, like a human beings, the whale can only live by\ninhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the\nnecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot\nin any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,\nthe Sperm Whales mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the\nsurface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his\nmouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the\ntop of his head.",
  "If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\nindispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\ncertain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the\nblood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I\nshall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.\nAssume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\naerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not\nfetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\nlive without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the\ncase with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full\nhour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or\nso much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has\nno gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine\nhe is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of\nvermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are\ncompletely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or\nmore, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of\nvitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert\ncarries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\nsupplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\nindisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable\nand true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\ninexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,\nas the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon\nrising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period\nof time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he\nstays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy\nbreaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his\nseventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few\nbreaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up\nagain to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those\nseventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full\nterm below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates\nare different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale\nthus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\nhis reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,\nthat this necessity for the whales rising exposes him to all the fatal\nhazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast\nleviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the\nsunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great\nnecessities that strike the victory to thee!",
  "It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;\nif it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,\nthen I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\nsmell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at\nall answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so\nclogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power\nof smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spoutwhether it be water\nor whether it be vaporno absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at\non this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no\nproper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no\nviolets, no Cologne-water in the sea.",
  "Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\ncanal, and as that long canallike the grand Erie Canalis furnished\nwith a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of\nair or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;\nunless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he\ntalks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?\nSeldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this\nworld, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\nliving. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!",
  "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\nfor the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\nhorizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\nto one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\nin a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether\nthis gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout\nof the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether\nthat exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\ndischarged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth\nindirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be\nproved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the\nspiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,\nwhen in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whales\nfood is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he\nwould. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\nwatch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating\nrhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of\nrespiration.",
  "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!\nYou have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not\ntell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to\nsettle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the\nknottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand\nin it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.",
  "The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\nit; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,\nwhen, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view\nof his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all\naround him. And if at such times you should think that you really\nperceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are\nnot merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are\nnot those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole\nfissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whales head? For\neven when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\nhis elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedarys in the desert; even then,\nthe whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a\nblazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\nrain.",
  "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\nprecise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\ninto it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\nthis fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\nslight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will\noften happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of\nthe thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer\ncontact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or\notherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.\nWherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to\nevade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt\nit, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind\nyou. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is\nto let this deadly spout alone.",
  "Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\nhypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides\nother reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\ntouching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I\naccount him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed\nfact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other\nwhales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am\nconvinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\nPlato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes\nup a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep\nthoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the\ncuriosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected\nthere, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over\nmy head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep\nthought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an\nAugust noon; this seems an additional argument for the above\nsupposition.",
  "And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\nbehold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\nhead overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable\ncontemplations, and that vaporas you will sometimes see itglorified\nby a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.\nFor, dye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate\nvapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my\nmind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a\nheavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;\nbut doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of\nall things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this\ncombination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who\nregards them both with equal eye.",
  "Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whales tail to begin at that point\nof the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises\nupon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.\nThe compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat\npalms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in\nthickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap,\nthen sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy\nbetween. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely\ndefined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost\nexpansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed\ntwenty feet across.",
  "The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\ninto it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:upper,\nmiddle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long\nand horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\ncrosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as\nanything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman\nwalls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin\ncourse of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\nrelics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the\ngreat strength of the masonry.",
  "But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,\nthe whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of\nmuscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins\nand running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and\nlargely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent\nmeasureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.\nCould annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.",
  "Nor does thisits amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful\nflexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a\nTitanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most\nappalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or\nharmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly\nbeautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied\ntendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved\nHercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the\nlinen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with\nthe massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.\nWhen Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what\nrobustness is there. And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in\nthe Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which\nhis idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so\ndestitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but\nthe mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on\nall hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his\nteachings.",
  "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathans tail acts in a\ndifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\nwriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\nwhale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\nforwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is\nthis which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster\nwhen furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.",
  "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\nfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his\nconflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In\nstriking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the\nblow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed\nair, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply\nirresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only\nsalvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the\nopposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the\nwhale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a\ndashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the\nmost serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received\nin the fishery, that they are accounted mere childs play. Some one\nstrips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.",
  "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\nthe sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\nthere is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\nelephants trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\nsweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\nslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\nthe sea; and if he feel but a sailors whisker, woe to that sailor,\nwhiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\nHad this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\nDarmonodes elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low\nsalutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\nzones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\npossess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\nanother elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his\ntrunk and extracted the dart.",
  "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\nmiddle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\nof his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\nhearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his\ntail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\nthunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a\ngreat gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of\nvapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that\nthat was the smoke from the touch-hole.",
  "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\nlie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely\nout of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into\nthe deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\ntossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they\ndownwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime _breach_somewhere\nelse to be describedthis peaking of the whales flukes is perhaps the\ngrandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless\nprofundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\nhighest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting\nforth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in\ngazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the\nDantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the\narchangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that\ncrimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,\nall heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with\npeaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment\nof adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of\nthe fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\nelephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most\ndevout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military\nelephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks\nuplifted in the profoundest silence.",
  "The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\nelephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\nof the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite\norgans on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\nrespectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to\nLeviathan, so, compared with Leviathans tail, his trunk is but the\nstalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephants trunk were\nas the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and\ncrash of the sperm whales ponderous flukes, which in repeated\ninstances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their\noars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his\nballs.*",
  "*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and\nthe elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the\nelephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does\nto the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of\ncurious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the\nelephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then\nelevating it, jet it forth in a stream.",
  "The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my\ninability to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which,\nthough they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly\ninexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are\nthese mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them\nakin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these\nmethods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting\nother motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,\nand unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I\nmay, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I\nknow not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much\nmore, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my\nback parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.\nBut I cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will\nabout his face, I say again he has no face.",
  "The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from\nthe territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia.\nIn a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of\nSumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast\nmole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and\ndividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded\noriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports\nfor the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are\nthe straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly,\nvessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.",
  "Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing\nmidway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green\npromontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond\nto the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and\nconsidering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,\nand gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental\nsea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such\ntreasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the\nappearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping\nwestern world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with\nthose domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the\nMediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these\nOrientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from\nthe endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries\npast, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra\nand Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while\nthey freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce\ntheir claim to more solid tribute.",
  "Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the\nlow shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the\nvessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the\npoint of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they\nhave received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these\ncorsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present\nday, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in\nthose waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.",
  "With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these\nstraits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and\nthence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here\nand there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands,\nand gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season\nthere. By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost\nall the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to\ndescending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere\nelse foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby\nDick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he\nmight most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.",
  "But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his\ncrew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time,\nnow, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs\nno sustenance but whats in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the\nwhaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be\ntransferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries\nno cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a\nwhole lakes contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with\nutilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She\ncarries years water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,\nwhen three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to\ndrink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks,\nfrom the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other\nships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at\na score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have\nsighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating\nseamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that\nanother flood had come; they would only answerWell, boys, heres the\nark!",
  "Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of\nJava, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of\nthe ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an\nexcellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and\nmore upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and\nadmonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the\nland soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the\nfresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was\ndescried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\nhereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the\ncustomary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle\nof singular magnificence saluted us.",
  "But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with\nwhich of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm\nWhales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached\ncompanies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive\nherds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost\nseem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and\ncovenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of\nthe Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the\ncircumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now\nsometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by\na single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems\nthousands on thousands.",
  "Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\nforming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a\ncontinuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the\nnoon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right\nWhale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the\ncleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of\nthe Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually\nrising and falling away to leeward.",
  "Seen from the Pequods deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of\nthe sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the\nair, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed\nlike the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried\nof a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.",
  "As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,\naccelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in\ntheir rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the\nplain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward\nthrough the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their\nsemicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.",
  "Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers\nhandling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet\nsuspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that\nchased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy\ninto the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their\nnumber. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby\nDick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped\nwhite-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with\nstun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans\nbefore us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly\ndirecting attention to something in our wake.",
  "Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our\nrear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling\nsomething like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so\ncompletely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally\ndisappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved\nin his pivot-hole, crying, Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to\nwet the sails;Malays, sir, and after us!",
  "As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should\nfairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in\nhot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the\nswift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how\nvery kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on\nto her own chosen pursuit,mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that\nthey were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in\nhis forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one\nthe bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_; some such fancy as the above\nseemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery\ndefile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that\nthrough that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that\nthrough that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his\ndeadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates\nand inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with\ntheir curses;when all these conceits had passed through his brain,\nAhabs brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after\nsome stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the\nfirm thing from its place.",
  "But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\nwhen, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\nPequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\nside, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\nharpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been\ngaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\nvictoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake\nof the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the\nship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to\nspring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed\nwonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three\nkeels that were after them,though as yet a mile in their rear,than\nthey rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that\ntheir spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved\non with redoubled velocity.",
  "Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\nafter several hours pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\nchase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating\ntoken that they were now at last under the influence of that strange\nperplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it\nin the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns in\nwhich they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now\nbroken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus elephants in\nthe Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with\nconsternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,\nand aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick\nspoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was\nstill more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely\nparalysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled\nships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple\nsheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not\npossibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional\ntimidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though\nbanding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the\nWest have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human\nbeings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatres pit,\nthey will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the\noutlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each\nother to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the\nstrangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts\nof the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.",
  "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\nyet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\nretreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\nthose cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone\nwhale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes time,\nQueequegs harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray\nin our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered\nstraight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part\nof the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise\nunprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;\nyet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the\nfishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the\nfrantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a\ndelirious throb.",
  "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\nspeed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\nthus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by\nthe crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was\nlike a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer\nthrough their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what\nmoment it may be locked in and crushed.",
  "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\nfrom this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away\nfrom that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the\ntime, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our\nway whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no\ntime to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their\nwonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to\nthe shouting part of the business. Out of the way, Commodore! cried\none, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,\nand for an instant threatened to swamp us. Hard down with your tail,\nthere! cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\ncalmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.",
  "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented\nby the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of\nequal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each\nothers grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then\nattached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line\nbeing looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is\nchiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more\nwhales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But\nsperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you\nmust kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you\nmust wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.\nHence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into\nrequisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and\nsecond were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly\nrunning off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing\ndrugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But\nupon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy\nwooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an\ninstant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the\nboats bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea\ncame in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and\nshirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.",
  "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it\nnot that as we advanced into the herd, our whales way greatly\ndiminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\nthe circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So\nthat when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale\nsideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\nmomentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the\nshoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\nvalley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost\nwhales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea\npresented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by\nthe subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods.\nYes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the\nheart of every commotion. And still in the distracted distance we\nbeheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive\npods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,\nlike multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to\nshoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the\nmiddle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the\ndensity of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding\nthe embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at\npresent afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that\nhemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us\nup. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by\nsmall tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.",
  "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\nouter circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in\nany one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by\nthe whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square\nmiles. At any ratethough indeed such a test at such a time might be\ndeceptivespoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed\nplaying up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this\ncircumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely\nlocked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd\nhad hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its\nstopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way\ninnocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller\nwhalesnow and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the\nlakeevinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still\nbecharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like\nhousehold dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,\nand touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\ndomesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched\ntheir backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\ntime refrained from darting it.",
  "But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\nstranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended\nin those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\nwhales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become\nmothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth\nexceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will\ncalmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two\ndifferent lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,\nbe still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;even so\ndid the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at\nus, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.\nFloating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One\nof these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a\nday old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six\nfeet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed\nscarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately\noccupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready\nfor the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartars bow.\nThe delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly\nretained the plaited crumpled appearance of a babys ears newly arrived\nfrom foreign parts.",
  "As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds\nof fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and\nshows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling\ntowards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord\nof Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to\nits dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this\nnatural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the\nhempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest\nsecrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We\nsaw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*",
  "*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\nunlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\ngestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but\none at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an\nEsau and Jacob:a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,\ncuriously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts\nthemselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious\nparts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunters lance, the mothers\npouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk\nis very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well\nwith strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales\nsalute _more hominum_.",
  "And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and\naffrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and\nfearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled\nin dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of\nmy being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;\nand while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down\nand deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.",
  "Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\nspectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,\nstill engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or\npossibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance\nof room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight\nof the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro\nacross the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is\nsometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful\nand alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or\nmaiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled\ncutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A\nwhale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not\neffectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying\nalong with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony\nof the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the\nlone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying\ndismay wherever he went.",
  "But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\nspectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed\nto inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first\nthe intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived\nthat by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale\nhad become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run\naway with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope\nattached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the\nharpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose\nfrom his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning\nthrough the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and\ntossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own\ncomrades.",
  "This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\nstationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\nbegan to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by\nhalf spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to\nheave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;\nin more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\ncircles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was\ndeparting. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the\ntumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in\nSpring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner\ncentre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly\nStarbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.",
  "The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a\nnarrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate\nendeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way\nrapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.\nAfter many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into\nwhat had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random\nwhales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was\ncheaply purchased by the loss of Queequegs hat, who, while standing in\nthe bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his\nhead by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad\nflukes close by.",
  "Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon\nresolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having\nclumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their\nonward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;\nbut the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged\nwhales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask\nhad killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of\nwhich are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at\nhand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both\nto mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,\nshould the boats of any other ship draw near.",
  "The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious\nsaying in the Fishery,the more whales the less fish. Of all the\ndrugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for\nthe time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some\nother craft than the Pequod.",
  "Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must\nhave been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are\noccasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.\nSuch bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those\ncomposed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young\nvigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.",
  "In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a\nmale of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces\nhis gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his\nladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about\nover the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and\nendearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his\nconcubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest\nleviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more\nthan one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are\ncomparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen\nyards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the\nwhole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_.",
  "It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\nramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in\nleisurely search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the\nfull flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,\nperhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating\nsummer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have\nlounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for\nthe Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so\nevade the other excessive temperature of the year.",
  "When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\nsuspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\ninteresting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan\ncoming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the\nladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases\nhim away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are\nto be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do\nwhat the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of\nhis bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often\ncause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with\nthe whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They\nfence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and\nso striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their\nantlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these\nencounters,furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some\ninstances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.",
  "But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at\nthe first rush of the harems lord, then is it very diverting to watch\nthat lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and\nrevels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,\nlike pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.\nGranting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give\nchase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish\nof their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the\nsons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must\ntake care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For\nlike certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my\nLord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower;\nand so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all\nover the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as\nthe ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as\nreflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude\novertakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the\nlove for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,\nadmonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to\nan exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians\nand parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from\nhis amorous errors.",
  "Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is\nthe lord and master of that school technically known as the\nschoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however\nadmirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should then\ngo abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.\nHis title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the\nname bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the\nman who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read\nthe memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a\ncountry-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and\nwhat was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of\nhis pupils.",
  "The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale\nbetakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm\nWhales. Almost universally, a lone whaleas a solitary Leviathan is\ncalledproves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone,\nhe will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to\nwife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though\nshe keeps so many moody secrets.",
  "The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously\nmentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while\nthose female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or\nforty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious\nof all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;\nexcepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,\nand these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.",
  "The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a\nmob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,\ntumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no\nprudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous\nlad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though,\nand when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about\nin quest of settlements, that is, harems.",
  "Another point of difference between the male and female schools is\nstill more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a\nForty-barrel-bullpoor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a\nmember of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with\nevery token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as\nthemselves to fall a prey.",
  "It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,\na whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed\nand captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised\nmany minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For\nexample,after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the\nbody may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and\ndrifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a\ncalm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the\nmost vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the\nfishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,\nundisputed law applicable to all cases.",
  "Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative\nenactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in\nA.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling\nlaw, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and\nlawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse\ncomprehensiveness surpasses Justinians Pandects and the By-laws of the\nChinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other Peoples\nBusiness. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Annes farthing,\nor the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.",
  "First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,\nwhen it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at\nall controllable by the occupant or occupants,a mast, an oar, a\nnine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the\nsame. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any\nother recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it\nplainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well\nas their intention so to do.",
  "These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\nthemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocksthe\nCoke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and\nhonorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where\nit would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim\npossession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But\nothers are by no means so scrupulous.",
  "Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated\nin England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of\na whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had\nsucceeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of\ntheir lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat\nitself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up\nwith the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it\nbefore the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were\nremonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs\nteeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had\ndone, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had\nremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore\nthe plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale,\nline, harpoons, and boat.",
  "Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the\njudge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to\nillustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,\nwherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wifes\nviciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\nthe course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to\nrecover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then\nsupported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally\nharpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\nthe great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned\nher; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\ntherefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then\nbecame that subsequent gentlemans property, along with whatever\nharpoon might have been found sticking in her.",
  "These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very\nlearned judge in set terms decided, to wit,That as for the boat, he\nawarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to\nsave their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,\nharpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because\nit was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons\nand line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)\nacquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards\ntook the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took\nthe fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.",
  "A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might\npossibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the\nmatter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws\npreviously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in\nthe above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,\nI say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human\njurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of\nsculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines,\nhas but two props to stand on.",
  "Is it not a saying in every ones mouth, Possession is half of the law:\nthat is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often\npossession is the whole of the law.

  "Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the\ncontext, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of\nthat land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,\nand the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division\nwhich, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no\nintermediate remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to\nthis day in force in England; and as it offers in various respects a\nstrange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is\nhere treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle\nthat prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate\ncar, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first\nplace, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is\nstill in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that\nhappened within the last two years.",
  "It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one\nof the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and\nbeaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from\nthe shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the\njurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.\nHolding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal\nemoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment\nhis. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so.\nBecause the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his\nperquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of\nthem.",
  "Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their\ntrowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their\nfat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good 150 from the\nprecious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their\nwives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their\nrespective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and\ncharitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and\nlaying it upon the whales head, he saysHands off! this fish, my\nmasters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Wardens. Upon this\nthe poor mariners in their respectful consternationso truly\nEnglishknowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their\nheads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the\nstranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the\nhard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At\nlength one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made\nbold to speak,",
  "In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of\nWellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular\nlights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be\ndeemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman\nof the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to\ntake the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To\nwhich my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)\nthat he had already done so, and received the money, and would be\nobliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend\ngentleman) would decline meddling with other peoples business. Is this\nthe still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three\nkingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?",
  "It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke\nto the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs\ninquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested\nwith that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon\ngives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs\nto the King and Queen, because of its superior excellence. And by the\nsoundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such\nmatters.",
  "In his treatise on Queen-Gold, or Queen-pinmoney, an old Kings Bench\nauthor, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: Ye tail is ye Queens,\nthat ye Queens wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone. Now this\nwas written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or\nRight whale was largely used in ladies bodices. But this same bone is\nnot in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a\nsagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be\npresented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.",
  "There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writersthe whale\nand the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and\nnominally supplying the tenth branch of the crowns ordinary revenue. I\nknow not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by\ninference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same\nway as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head\npeculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be\nhumorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there\nseems a reason in all things, even in law.",
  "It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when\nwe were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the\nmany noses on the Pequods deck proved more vigilant discoverers than\nthe three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell\nwas smelt in the sea.",
  "Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance\nlay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must\nbe alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours\nfrom his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that\ncircled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the\nwhale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that\nis, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an\nunappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor\nsuch a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague,\nwhen the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable\nindeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to\nmoor alongside of it. Yet are there those who will still do it;\nnotwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of\na very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of\nattar-of-rose.",
  "Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman\nhad a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of\na nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those\nproblematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of\nprodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies\nalmost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the\nproper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up\nhis nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted\nwhales in general.",
  "Theres a pretty fellow, now, he banteringly laughed, standing in the\nships bows, theres a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes\nof Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering\ntheir boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,\nand sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of\ntallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they\nwill get wont be enough to dip the Captains wick into; aye, we all\nknow these things; but look ye, heres a Crappo that is content with\nour leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too\nwith scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.\nPoor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and lets make him a\npresent of a little oil for dear charitys sake. For what oil hell get\nfrom that drugged whale there, wouldnt be fit to burn in a jail; no,\nnot in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, Ill agree to\nget more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours,\nthan hell get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of\nit, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes,\nambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. Its worth\ntrying. Yes, Im for it; and so saying he started for the\nquarter-deck.",
  "By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether\nor no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope\nof escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin,\nStubb now called his boats crew, and pulled off for the stranger.\nDrawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the\nfanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in\nthe likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for\nthorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole\nterminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon\nher head boards, in large gilt letters, he read Bouton de\nRose,Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this\naromatic ship.",
  "Oh! keep coolcool? yes, thats the word! why dont you pack those\nwhales in ice while youre working at em? But joking aside, though; do\nyou know, Rose-bud, that its all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\nsuch whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasnt a gill in his\nwhole carcase.",
  "Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow, rejoined Stubb,\nand with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene\npresented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were\ngetting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked\nrather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good\nhumor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many\njib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up\nto the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch\nthe plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their\nnostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\noff at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\nconstantly filled their olfactories.",
  "Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from\nthe Captains round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a\nfiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from\nwithin. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\nremonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\nto the Captains round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the\npest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\nindignations at times.",
  "Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\nGuernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\nexpressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who\nhad brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.\nSounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man\nhad not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore\nheld his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\nconfidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\nfor both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\ndreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan\nof theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreters office,\nwas to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and\nas for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost\nin him during the interview.",
  "By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a\nsmall and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with\nlarge whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet\nvest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now\npolitely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put\non the aspect of interpreting between them.",
  "By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed\nthe Guernsey-man to this effect,that having a long tow-line in his\nboat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the\nlighter whale of the two from the ships side. While the Frenchmans\nboats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb\nbenevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously\nslacking out a most unusually long tow-line.",
  "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\nhoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while\nthe Pequod slid in between him and Stubbs whale. Whereupon Stubb\nquickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give\nnotice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his\nunrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an\nexcavation in the body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost\nhave thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at\nlength his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up\nold Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boats crew\nwere all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking\nas anxious as gold-hunters.",
  "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\nscreaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning\nto look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased,\nwhen suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a\nfaint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells\nwithout being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then\nalong with another, without at all blending with it for a time.",
  "Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\nsomething that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\ncheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with\nyour thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this,\ngood friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\ndruggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably\nlost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were\nit not for impatient Ahabs loud command to Stubb to desist, and come\non board, else the ship would bid them good bye.",
  "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an\narticle of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\nCoffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that\nsubject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,\nthe precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem\nto the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound\nfor grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber,\nthough at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far\ninland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.\nBesides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,\nused for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris\nis soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely\nused in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and\npomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for\nthe same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peters in Rome.\nSome wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.",
  "Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\nregale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\nsick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\ncause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to\ncure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\nthree or four boat loads of Brandreths pills, and then running out of\nharms way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.",
  "Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\nfound in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that\nsaying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;\nhow that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise\ncall to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the\nbest musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of\nill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is\nthe worst.",
  "I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\ncannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\nwhalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\nmight be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\nof the Frenchmans two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous\naspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is\nthroughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to\nrebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this\nodious stigma originate?",
  "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\nGreenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because\nthose whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea\nas the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh\nblubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks,\nand carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those\nIcy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed,\nforbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking\ninto the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the\nGreenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising\nfrom excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a\nLying-in Hospital.",
  "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\nlikewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\ntimes, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\nlatter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great\nwork on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports\n(smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to\nafford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried\nout, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a\ncollection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works\nwere in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But\nall this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a\nvoyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with\noil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling\nout; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.\nThe truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a\nspecies are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be\nrecognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew\nin the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be\notherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high\nhealth; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it\nis true, seldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm\nWhales flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented\nlady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the\nSperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be\nto that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh,\nwhich was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great?",
  "It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most\nsignificant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequods crew;\nan event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes\nmadly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying\nprophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.",
  "Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.\nSome few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is\nto work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general\nthing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising\nthe boats crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy,\nor timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a\nship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by\nnick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before;\nye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so\ngloomy-jolly.",
  "In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and\na white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven\nin one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull\nand torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at\nbottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness\npeculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and\nfestivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks,\nthe years calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five\nFourth of Julys and New Years Days. Nor smile so, while I write that\nthis little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;\nbehold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in kings cabinets. But Pip loved\nlife, and all lifes peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking\nbusiness in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had\nmost sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen,\nwhat was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be\nluridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him\noff to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland\nCounty in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddlers frolic on\nthe green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned\nthe round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the\nclear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the\npure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning\njeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he\nlays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun,\nbut by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences,\ninfernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest\nsymbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from\nthe King of Hell. But let us to the story.",
  "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\nbut happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\ntherefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing\nhim, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness\nto the utmost, for he might often find it needful.",
  "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\nthe fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\nhappened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pips seat. The\ninvoluntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\nhand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale\nline coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as\nto become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That\ninstant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly\nstraightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of\nthe boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken\nseveral turns around his chest and neck.",
  "Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He\nhated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he\nsuspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\nexclaimed interrogatively, Cut? Meantime Pips blue, choked face\nplainly looked, Do, for Gods sake! All passed in a flash. In less than\nhalf a minute, this entire thing happened.",
  "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by\nyells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these\nirregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,\nbut still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,\nunofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never\njump from a boat, Pip, exceptbut all the rest was indefinite, as the\nsoundest advice ever is. Now, in general, _Stick to the boat_, is your\ntrue motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when _Leap from\nthe boat_, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if\nhe should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be\nleaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly\ndropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, Stick to\nthe boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I wont pick you up if you jump; mind\nthat. We cant afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would\nsell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in\nmind, and dont jump any more. Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted,\nthat though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,\nwhich propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.",
  "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\nunder very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this\ntime he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started\nto run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried travellers\ntrunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful,\nbounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly\nstretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beaters skin\nhammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pips\nebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when\nhe fell so rapidly astern. Stubbs inexorable back was turned upon him;\nand the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless\nocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor\nPip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely\ncastaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.",
  "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\npractised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful\nlonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the\nmiddle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,\nhow when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open seamark how closely\nthey hug their ship and only coast along her sides.",
  "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No;\nhe did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,\nand he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip\nvery quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations\ntowards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always\nmanifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances\nnot unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so\ncalled, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\nmilitary navies and armies.",
  "But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\nspying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and\nStubbs boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\nupon his fish, that Pips ringed horizon began to expand around him\nmiserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;\nbut from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such,\nat least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body\nup, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.\nRather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of\nthe unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;\nand the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the\njoyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,\nGod-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters\nheaved the colossal orbs. He saw Gods foot upon the treadle of the\nloom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So\nmans insanity is heavens sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,\nman comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is\nabsurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,\nindifferent as his God.",
  "It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with\nseveral others, I sat down before a large Constantines bath of it, I\nfound it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about\nin the liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back\ninto fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this\nsperm was such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener!\nsuch a softener! such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it\nfor only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it\nwere, to serpentine and spiralise.",
  "As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter\nexertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under\nindolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands\namong those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost\nwithin the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all\ntheir opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that\nuncontaminated aroma,literally and truly, like the smell of spring\nviolets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky\nmeadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible\nsperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit\nthe old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in\nallaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely\nfree from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort\nwhatsoever.",
  "Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm\ntill I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a\nstrange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly\nsqueezing my co-laborers hands in it, mistaking their hands for the\ngentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving\nfeeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually\nsqueezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as\nmuch as to say,Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish\nany social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;\nlet us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into\neach other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and\nsperm of kindness.",
  "Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since\nby many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all\ncases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of\nattainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the\nfancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the\nfireside, the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready\nto squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I\nsaw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of\nspermaceti.",
  "First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering\npart of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It\nis tough with congealed tendonsa wad of musclebut still contains some\noil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut\ninto portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like\nblocks of Berkshire marble.",
  "Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the\nwhales flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and\noften participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is\na most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name\nimports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked\nsnowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and\npurple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,\nit is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I\nstole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should\nconceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have\ntasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after the\nvenison season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an\nunusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.",
  "There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in\nthe course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling\nadequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation\noriginal with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.\nIt is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the\ntubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I\nhold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,\ncoalescing.",
  "Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but\nsometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the\ndark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the\nGreenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those\ninferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.",
  "Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whales\nvocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whalemans\nnipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering\npart of Leviathans tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the\nrest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along\nthe oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless\nblandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.",
  "But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at\nonce to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its\ninmates. This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for\nthe blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the\nproper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a\nscene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by\na dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They\ngenerally go in pairs,a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The\nwhaling-pike is similar to a frigates boarding-weapon of the same\nname. The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the\ngaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from\nslipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the\nspade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into\nthe portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the\nspademans feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes\nirresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of\nhis own toes, or one of his assistants, would you be very much\nastonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.",
  "Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this\npost-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the\nwindlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small\ncuriosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen\nthere, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous\ncistern in the whales huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower\njaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so\nsurprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,longer than\na Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and\njet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it\nis; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that\nfound in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for\nworshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the\nidol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly\nset forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings.",
  "Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and\nassisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners\ncall it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a\ngrenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the\nforecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt,\nas an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt\ninside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as\nalmost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in\nthe rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some\nthree feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two\nslits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself\nbodily into it. The mincer now stands before you invested in the full\ncanonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this\ninvestiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the\npeculiar functions of his office.",
  "That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the\npots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,\nplanted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath\nit, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt\norators desk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit;\nintent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a\nlad for a Pope were this mincer!*",
  "*Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates\nto the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as\nthin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of\nboiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably\nincreased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.",
  "The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most\nroomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,\nfitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and\nmortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The\nfoundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly\nsecured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all\nsides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased\nwith wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened\nhatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in\nnumber, and each of several barrels capacity. When not in use, they\nare kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone\nand sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the\nnight-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil\nthemselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing themone\nman in each pot, side by sidemany confidential communications are\ncarried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound\nmathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod,\nwith the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first\nindirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies\ngliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from\nany point in precisely the same time.",
  "Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare\nmasonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of\nthe furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted\nwith heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented\nfrom communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir\nextending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel\ninserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as\nfast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct\nfrom the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.",
  "All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the\nworks. This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting\nhis shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said\nthat in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed\nfor a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of\nquick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out,\nthe crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still\ncontains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed\nthe flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming\nmisanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by\nhis own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is\nhorrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you\nmust live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor\nabout it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells\nlike the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the\npit.",
  "By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the\ncarcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean\ndarkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce\nflames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and\nilluminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek\nfire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to\nsome vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the\nbold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad\nsheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and\nfolded them in conflagrations.",
  "The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide\nhearth in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of\nthe pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ships stokers. With huge\npronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding\npots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted,\ncurling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled\naway in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of\nthe boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces.\nOpposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden\nhearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the\nwatch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the\nfire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny\nfeatures, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards,\nand the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were\nstrangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they\nnarrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror\ntold in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards\nout of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their\nfront, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged\nforks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the\nship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further\nand further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\nchamped the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on\nall sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden\nwith fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of\ndarkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commanders\nsoul.",
  "So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently\nguided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that\ninterval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the\nmadness, the ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend\nshapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at\nlast begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to\nthat unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a\nmidnight helm.",
  "But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)\nthing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was\nhorribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller\nsmote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of\nsails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were\nopen; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and\nmechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all\nthis, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed\nbut a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle\nlamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and\nthen made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression,\nthat whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to\nany haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered\nfeeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the\ntiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in\nsome enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me?\nthought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was\nfronting the ships stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In\nan instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying\nup into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how\ngrateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and\nthe fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!",
  "Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy\nhand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first\nhint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its\nredness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun,\nthe skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking\nflames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the\nglorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lampall others but liars!",
  "Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginias Dismal Swamp, nor Romes\naccursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of\ndeserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean,\nwhich is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this\nearth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow\nin him, that mortal man cannot be truenot true, or undeveloped. With\nbooks the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the\ntruest of all books is Solomons, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered\nsteel of woe. All is vanity. ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold\nof unchristian Solomons wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and\njails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of\noperas than hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils\nall of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais\nas passing wise, and therefore jolly;not that man is fitted to sit\ndown on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably\nwondrous Solomon.",
  "But even Solomon, he says, the man that wandereth out of the way of\nunderstanding shall remain (_i.e._, even while living) in the\ncongregation of the dead. Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it\ninvert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom\nthat is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a\nCatskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest\ngorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny\nspaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is\nin the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle\nis still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.",
  "Had you descended from the Pequods try-works to the Pequods\nforecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single\nmoment you would have almost thought you were standing in some\nilluminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay\nin their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a\nscore of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.",
  "In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of\nqueens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in\ndarkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he\nseeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an\nAladdins lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night\nthe ships black hull still houses an illumination.",
  "See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of\nlampsoften but old bottles and vials, thoughto the copper cooler at\nthe try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He\nburns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore,\nunvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral\ncontrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He\ngoes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and\ngenuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own\nsupper of game.",
  "Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off\ndescried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,\nand slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed\nalongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the\nheadsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his\ngreat padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in\ndue time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and\nAbednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the\nfire;but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of\nthe description by rehearsingsinging, if I maythe romantic proceeding\nof decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the\nhold, where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities,\nsliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to\nrise and blow.",
  "While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the\nsix-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling\nthis way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed\nround and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot\nacross the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last\nman-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,\nrap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, _ex officio_,\nevery sailor is a cooper.",
  "At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the\ngreat hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,\nand down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the\nhatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.",
  "In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable\nincidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream\nwith freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous\nmasses of the whales head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie\nabout, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted\nall the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the\nentire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din\nis deafening.",
  "But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\nself-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,\nyou would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a\nmost scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil\npossesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the\ndecks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of\noil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a\npotent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back\nof the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly\nexterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with\nbuckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot\nis brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous implements which\nhave been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. The\ngreat hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works, completely\nhiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in\nunseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of\nalmost the entire ships company, the whole of this conscientious duty\nis at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own\nablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the\nimmaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from\nout the daintiest Holland.",
  "Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and\nhumorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;\npropose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not\nto taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to\nsuch musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short\nof audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and\nbring us napkins!",
  "But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent\non spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil\nthe old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot\nsomewhere. Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest\nuninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight through\nfor ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their\nwrists with all day rowing on the Line,they only step to the deck to\ncarry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash,\nyea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the\ncombined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works;\nwhen, on the heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves\nto cleanse the ship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the\ntime the poor fellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks,\nare startled by the cry of There she blows! and away they fly to\nfight another whale, and go through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my\nfriends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we\nmortals by long toilings extracted from this worlds vast bulk its\nsmall but valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed\nourselves from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean\ntabernacles of the soul; hardly is this done, when_There she\nblows!_the ghost is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other\nworld, and go through young lifes old routine again.",
  "Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,\ntaking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in\nthe multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been\nadded how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,\nhe was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely\neyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the\nbinnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the\ncompass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of\nhis purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the\nmainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted\ngold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only\ndashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.",
  "But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly\nattracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as\nthough now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in\nsome monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some\ncertain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little\nworth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell\nby the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass\nin the Milky Way.",
  "Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of\nthe heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands,\nthe head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst\nall the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes,\nyet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its\nQuito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour\npassed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with\nthick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless\nevery sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it\nwas set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however\nwanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as\nthe white whales talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary\nwatch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he\nwould ever live to spend it.",
  "Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun\nand tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; suns\ndisks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,\nare in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems\nalmost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by\npassing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.",
  "It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy\nexample of these things. On its round border it bore the letters,\nREPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country\nplanted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and\nnamed after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the\nunwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the\nlikeness of three Andes summits; from one a flame; a tower on another;\non the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of\nthe partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual\ncabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at\nLibra.",
  "Theres something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and\nall other grand and lofty things; look here,three peaks as proud as\nLucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the\ncourageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all\nare Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,\nwhich, like a magicians glass, to each and every man in turn but\nmirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for\nthose who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks\nnow this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the\nsign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out\nof a former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born\nin throes, tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So\nbe it, then! Heres stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.",
  "No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devils claws must\nhave left their mouldings there since yesterday, murmured Starbuck to\nhimself, leaning against the bulwarks. The old man seems to read\nBelshazzars awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly.\nHe goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty,\nheaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint\nearthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over\nall our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a\nhope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;\nbut if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to\ncheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we\nwould fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain!\nThis coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will\nquit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.",
  "There nows the old Mogul, soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, hes\nbeen twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with\nfaces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long.\nAnd all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on\nNegro Hill or in Corlaers Hook, Id not look at it very long ere\nspending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as\nqueer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons\nof old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your\ndoubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold\nmoidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What\nthen should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing\nwonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! heres signs and\nwonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the\nzodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. Ill get the almanac and\nas I have heard devils can be raised with Dabolls arithmetic, Ill try\nmy hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the\nMassachusetts calendar. Heres the book. Lets see now. Signs and\nwonders; and the sun, hes always among em. Hem, hem, hem; here they\narehere they goall alive:Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and\nJimimi! heres Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels\namong em. Aye, here on the coin hes just crossing the threshold\nbetween two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there;\nthe fact is, you books must know your places. Youll do to give us the\nbare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. Thats my\nsmall experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditchs\nnavigator, and Dabolls arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if\nthere is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders!\nTheres a clue somewhere; wait a bit; histhark! By Jove, I have it!\nLook you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round\nchapter; and now Ill read it off, straight out of the book. Come,\nAlmanack! To begin: theres Aries, or the Ramlecherous dog, he begets\nus; then, Taurus, or the Bullhe bumps us the first thing; then Gemini,\nor the Twinsthat is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo!\ncomes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue,\nLeo, a roaring Lion, lies in the pathhe gives a few fierce bites and\nsurly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! thats\nour first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes\nLibra, or the Scaleshappiness weighed and found wanting; and while we\nare very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the\nScorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang\ncome the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing\nhimself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! heres the\nbattering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing,\nand headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours\nout his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the\nFishes, we sleep. Theres a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the\nsun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and\nhearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and\nso, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jollys the word for aye! Adieu,\nDoubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the\ntry-works, now, and lets hear what hell have to say. There; hes\nbefore it; hell out with something presently. So, so; hes beginning.",
  "I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises\na certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, whats all this\nstaring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, thats true; and at\ntwo cents the cigar, thats nine hundred and sixty cigars. I wont\nsmoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and heres nine\nhundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy em out.",
  "Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a\nfoolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of\nwiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxmanthe old\nhearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea.\nHe luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other\nside of the mast; why, theres a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and\nnow hes back again; what does that mean? Hark! hes mutteringvoice\nlike an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!",
  "If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when\nthe sun stands in some one of these signs. Ive studied signs, and know\ntheir marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch\nin Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe\nsign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And whats the\nhorse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe signthe roaring and\ndevouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.",
  "Theres another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in\none kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequegall\ntattooinglooks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the\nCannibal?

Ah, only makes a sign to the\nsign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coinfire worshipper,\ndepend upon it. Ho! more and more. This way comes Pippoor boy! would\nhe had died, or I; hes half horrible to me. He too has been watching\nall of these interpretersmyself includedand look now, he comes to\nread, with that unearthly idiot face. Stand away again and hear him.\nHark!",
  "And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and Im a\ncrow, especially when I stand atop of this pine tree here. Caw! caw!\ncaw! caw! caw! caw! Aint I a crow? And wheres the scare-crow? There\nhe stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more\npoked into the sleeves of an old jacket.",
  "Heres the ships navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire\nto unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and whats the consequence?\nThen again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aughts\nnailed to the mast its a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old\nAhab! the White Whale; hell nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father,\nin old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver\nring grown over in it; some old darkeys wedding ring. How did it get\nthere? And so theyll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish\nup this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters\nfor the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the\ngreen miserll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes mong the worlds\nblackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey,\nhey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!",
  "So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,\nbearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was\nstanding in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to\nthe stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boats\nbow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of\nsixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round\nhim in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket\nstreamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussars surcoat.",
  "In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\ncrew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\nstranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the\nexcitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his\nleg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his\nown, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical\ncontrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and\nshipped in any other vessel at a moments warning. Now, it is no very\neasy matter for anybodyexcept those who are almost hourly used to it,\nlike whalemento clamber up a ships side from a boat on the open sea;\nfor the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,\nand then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So,\ndeprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether\nunsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly\nreduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain\nchangeful height he could hardly hope to attain.",
  "It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\ncircumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\nluckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And\nin the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the\ntwo officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\nperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a\npair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem\nto bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\nuse their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,\nbecause the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,\ncried out, I see, I see!avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing\nover the cutting-tackle.",
  "As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\nprevious, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\ncurved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.\nThis was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,\nslid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting\nin the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then\ngiving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to\nhoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running\nparts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high\nbulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm\nfrankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab,\nputting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two\nsword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, Aye, aye, hearty! let\nus shake bones together!an arm and a leg!an arm that never can\nshrink, dye see; and a leg that never can run. Where didst thou see\nthe White Whale?how long ago?",
  "It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,\nbegan the Englishman. I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.\nWell, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat\nfastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went\nmilling and milling round so, that my boats crew could only trim dish,\nby sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches\nfrom the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white\nhead and hump, all crows feet and wrinkles.",
  "How it was exactly, continued the one-armed commander, I do not\nknow; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there\nsomehow; but we didnt know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled\non the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other\nwhales; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters\nstood, and what a noble great whale it wasthe noblest and biggest I\never saw, sir, in my lifeI resolved to capture him, spite of the\nboiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would\nget loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a\ndevil of a boats crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I\nsay, I jumped into my first mates boatMr. Mounttops here (by the\nway, CaptainMounttop; Mounttopthe captain);as I was saying, I jumped\ninto Mounttops boat, which, dye see, was gunwale and gunwale with\nmine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old\ngreat-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sirhearts and souls\nalive, manthe next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a batboth eyes\noutall befogged and bedeadened with black foamthe whales tail\nlooming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble\nsteeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday,\nwith a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after\nthe second iron, to toss it overboarddown comes the tail like a Lima\ntower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,\nflukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was\nall chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I\nseized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung\nto that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at\nthe same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down\nlike a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near\nme caught me here (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); yes,\ncaught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hells flames, I was\nthinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb\nript its way along the fleshclear along the whole length of my\narmcame out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;and that gentleman there\nwill tell you the rest (by the way, captainDr. Bunger, ships surgeon:\nBunger, my lad,the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the\nyarn.",
  "The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all\nthe time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote\nhis gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but\nsober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and\npatched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between\na marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,\noccasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two\ncrippled captains. But, at his superiors introduction of him to Ahab,\nhe politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captains bidding.",
  "Oh, very severe! chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly\naltering his voice, Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till\nhe couldnt see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half\nseas over, about three oclock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up\nwith me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher,\nand very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh\nout! why dont ye? You know youre a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave\nahead, boy, Id rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other\nman.",
  "My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sirsaid the\nimperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahabis apt to\nbe facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But\nI may as well sayen passant, as the French remarkthat I myselfthat\nis to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergyam a strict total\nabstinence man; I never drink",
  "Yes, I may as well, said the surgeon, coolly. I was about observing,\nsir, before Captain Boomers facetious interruption, that spite of my\nbest and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse;\nthe truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw;\nmore than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead\nline. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it\ncame. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is\nagainst all rulepointing at it with the marlingspikethat is the\ncaptains work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had\nthat club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some ones brains out\nwith, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical\npassions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sirremoving his hat, and\nbrushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,\nbut which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever\nhaving been a woundWell, the captain there will tell you how that\ncame here; he knows.",
  "No, I dont, said the captain, but his mother did; he was born with\nit. Oh, you solemn rogue, youyou Bunger! was there ever such another\nBunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in\npickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.",
  "Oh! cried the one-armed captain, oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we\ndidnt see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I\ndidnt then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,\ntill some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about\nMoby Dickas some call himand then I knew it was he.",
  "Well, then, interrupted Bunger, give him your left arm for bait to\nget the right. Do you know, gentlemenvery gravely and mathematically\nbowing to each Captain in successionDo you know, gentlemen, that the\ndigestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine\nProvidence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest\neven a mans arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the\nWhite Whales malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to\nswallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But\nsometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of\nmine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a\ntime let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a\ntwelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in\nsmall tacks, dye see. No possible way for him to digest that\njack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.\nYes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind\nto pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial\nto the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale\nhave another chance at you shortly, thats all.",
  "No, thank ye, Bunger, said the English Captain, hes welcome to the\narm he has, since I cant help it, and didnt know him then; but not to\nanother one. No more White Whales for me; Ive lowered for him once,\nand that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I\nknow that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark\nye, hes best let alone; dont you think so, Captain?glancing at the\nivory leg.",
  "Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she\nhailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,\nmerchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of\nEnderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whalemans opinion, comes not\nfar behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point\nof real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord\n1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous\nfish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out\nthe first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;\nthough for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant\nCoffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets\npursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not\nelsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were\nthe first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm\nWhale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the\nwhole globe who so harpooned him.",
  "In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,\nand at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape\nHorn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any\nsort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;\nand returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm,\nthe Amelias example was soon followed by other ships, English and\nAmerican, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were\nthrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable\nhouse again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sonshow many, their\nmother only knowsand under their immediate auspices, and partly, I\nthink, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the\nsloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South\nSea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling\nvoyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this\nis not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship\nof their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.\nThat shipwell called the Syrenmade a noble experimental cruise; and\nit was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became\ngenerally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a\nCaptain Coffin, a Nantucketer.",
  "The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast\nsailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight\nsomewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the\nforecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumpsevery\nsoul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine\ngam I hadlong, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his\nivory heelit minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that\nship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever\nlose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it\nat the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for its\nsqually off there by Patagonia), and all handsvisitors and allwere\ncalled to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each\nother aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our\njackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the\nhowling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts\ndid not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that\nwe had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting\ndown the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to\nmy taste.",
  "The beef was finetough, but with body in it. They said it was\nbull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for\ncertain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,\nsymmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that\nyou could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were\nswallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their\npitching out of you like billiard-balls. The breadbut that couldnt be\nhelped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread\ncontained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very\nlight, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you\nate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the\ndimensions of the cooks boilers, including his own live parchment\nboilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of\ngood fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and\ncapital from boot heels to hat-band.",
  "But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other\nEnglish whalers I know ofnot all thoughwere such famous, hospitable\nships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the\njoke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I\nwill tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is\nmatter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of\nhistorical whale research, when it has seemed needed.",
  "The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,\nZealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant\nin the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching\nplenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English\nmerchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence,\nin the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and\nnatural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some\nspecial origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further\nelucidated.",
  "During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\nancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew\nmust be about whalers. The title was, Dan Coopman, wherefore I\nconcluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam\ncooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was\nreinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one\nFitz Swackhammer. But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,\nprofessor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus\nand St. Potts, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a\nbox of sperm candles for his troublethis same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as\nhe spied the book, assured me that Dan Coopman did not mean The\nCooper, but The Merchant. In short, this ancient and learned Low\nDutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other\nsubjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery.\nAnd in this chapter it was, headed, Smeer, or Fat, that I found a\nlong detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180\nsail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead,\nI transcribe the following:",
  "At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this\nbeer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were\nincidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic\napplication; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my\nown, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by\nevery Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen\nwhale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and\nLeyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their\nnaturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the\nnature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game\nin those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux\ncountry where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of\ntrain oil.",
  "The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those\npolar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\nclimate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,\nincluding the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not\nmuch exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their\nfleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I\nsay, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks\nallowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.\nNow, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might\nfancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a\nboats head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem\nsomewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But\nthis was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with\nthe constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would\nbe apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his\nboat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.",
  "But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of\ntwo or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English\nwhalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when\ncruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the\nworld, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the\ndecanter.",
  "Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly\ndwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail\nupon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough\nsweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still\nfurther, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters,\nand casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost\nbones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his\nunconditional skeleton.",
  "But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the\nfishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the\nwhale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures\non the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a\nspecimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a\nfull-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a\nroast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,\nIshmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;\nthe privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters,\nridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of\nleviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and\ncheeseries in his bowels.",
  "I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far\nbeneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed\nwith an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged\nto, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his\npoke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the\nheads of the lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my\nboat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the\ncontents of that young cub?",
  "And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their\ngigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted\nto my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides.\nFor being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey\nof Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with\nthe lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side\nglen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his\ncapital.",
  "Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted\nwith a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought\ntogether in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his\npeople could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,\nchiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and\nall these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the\nwonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.",
  "Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an\nunusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his\nhead against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings\nseemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of\nits fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,\nthen the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where\na grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.",
  "The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebr were carved with\nArsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests\nkept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again\nsent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the\nterrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung\nsword that so affrighted Damocles.",
  "It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen;\nthe trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the\nindustrious earth beneath was as a weavers loom, with a gorgeous\ncarpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and\nwoof, and the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their\nladen branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the\nmessage-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the\nlacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving\nthe unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!pause!one\nword!whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all\nthese ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!stay thy hand!but one single\nword with thee! Naythe shuttle fliesthe figures float from forth the\nloom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god,\nhe weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal\nvoice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;\nand only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak\nthrough it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken\nwords that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words\nare plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened\ncasements. Thereby have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be\nheedful; for so, in all this din of the great worlds loom, thy\nsubtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.",
  "Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the\ngreat, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounginga gigantic idler! Yet,\nas the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around\nhim, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over\nwith the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but\nhimself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim\ngod wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.",
  "Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the\nskull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real\njet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an\nobject of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests\nshould swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced\nbefore this skeletonbrushed the vines asidebroke through the ribsand\nwith a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many\nwinding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and\nfollowing it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no\nliving thing within; naught was there but bones.",
  "Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the\nskeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me\ntaking the altitude of the final rib, How now! they shouted; Darst\nthou measure this our god! Thats for us. Aye, priestswell, how long\ndo ye make him, then? But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them,\nconcerning feet and inches; they cracked each others sconces with\ntheir yard-sticksthe great skull echoedand seizing that lucky chance,\nI quickly concluded my own admeasurements.",
  "These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it\nrecorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied\nmeasurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can\nrefer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell\nme, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where\nthey have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise,\nI have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they\nhave what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of a\nGreenland or River Whale in the United States. Moreover, at a place in\nYorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford\nConstable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of\nmoderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend\nKing Tranquos.",
  "In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons\nbelonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar\ngrounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir\nClifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir\nCliffords whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great\nchest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony\ncavitiesspread out his ribs like a gigantic fanand swing all day upon\nhis lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and\nshutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of\nkeys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep\nat the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the\necho in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled\nview from his forehead.",
  "The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied\nverbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild\nwanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving\nsuch valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished\nthe other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then\ncomposingat least, what untattooed parts might remainI did not\ntrouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all\nenter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.",
  "According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base\nupon Captain Scoresbys estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized\nGreenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful\ncalculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between\neighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty\nfeet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least\nninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would\nconsiderably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one\nthousand one hundred inhabitants.",
  "Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,\njaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\nsimply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\nunobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a\nproportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the\nmost complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it\nin this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under\nyour arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion\nof the general structure we are about to view.",
  "In length, the Sperm Whales skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\nfeet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\nbeen ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\nfifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two\nfeet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty\nfeet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less\nthan a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs\nwhich once enclosed his vitals.",
  "To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\nextending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\nthe hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\ntwenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\nfor the time, but a long, disconnected timber.",
  "The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was\nnearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\nsuccessively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\nof the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From\nthat part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only\nspanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore\na seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most\narched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\nfootpath bridges over small streams.",
  "In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\ncircumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of\nthe whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of\nthe Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the\nfish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of\nthe invested body of this particular whale must have been at least\nsixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more\nthan eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion\nof the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I\nnow saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with\ntons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for\nthe ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of\nthe weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!",
  "How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try\nto comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his\ndead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in\nthe heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his\nangry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully\ninvested whale be truly and livingly found out.",
  "There are forty and odd vertebr in all, which in the skeleton are not\nlocked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a\nGothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a\nmiddle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth\nmore than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the\ntail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white\nbilliard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they\nhad been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priests children,\nwho had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the\nspine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into\nsimple childs play.",
  "From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon\nto enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not\ncompress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial\nfolio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and\nthe yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic\ninvolutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables\nand hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a\nline-of-battle-ship.",
  "Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to\napprove myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not\noverlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him\nout to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him\nin most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now\nremains to magnify him in an archological, fossiliferous, and\nantediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the\nLeviathanto an ant or a fleasuch portly terms might justly be deemed\nunwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case\nis altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest\nwords of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been\nconvenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have\ninvariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased\nfor that purpose; because that famous lexicographers uncommon personal\nbulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author\nlike me.",
  "One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,\nthough it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of\nthis Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard\ncapitals. Give me a condors quill! Give me Vesuvius crater for an\ninkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my\nthoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their\noutreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole\ncircle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and\nmastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas\nof empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding\nits suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and\nliberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you\nmust choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be\nwritten on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.",
  "Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my\ncredentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I\nhave been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and\nwells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by\nway of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the\nearlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now\nalmost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are\ncalled the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate\nintercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose\nremote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil\nWhales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the\nlast preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them\nprecisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet\nsufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking\nrank as Cetacean fossils.",
  "Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones\nand skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals,\nbeen found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England,\nin Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\nAmong the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the\nyear 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street\nopening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones\ndisinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleons\ntime. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some\nutterly unknown Leviathanic species.",
  "But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost\ncomplete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,\non the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken\ncredulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the\nfallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and\nbestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of\nit being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned\nout that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed\nspecies. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again\nrepeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but\nlittle clue to the shape of his fully invested body. So Owen\nrechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the\nLondon Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the most\nextraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted\nout of existence.",
  "When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,\njaws, ribs, and vertebr, all characterized by partial resemblances to\nthe existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on\nthe other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical\nLeviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to\nthat wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for\ntime began with man. Here Saturns grey chaos rolls over me, and I\nobtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when\nwedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and\nin all the 25,000 miles of this worlds circumference, not an\ninhabitable hands breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world\nwas the whales; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the\npresent lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree\nlike Leviathan? Ahabs harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaohs.\nMethuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I\nam horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the\nunspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time,\nmust needs exist after all humane ages are over.",
  "But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the\nstereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his\nancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim\nfor them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable\nprint of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some\nfifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a\nsculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins,\nand dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe\nof the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was\nthere swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was\ncradled.",
  "Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams\nof which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are\noftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine,\nthat by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can\npass it without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that\non either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into\nthe Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon em. They keep a\nWhales Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the\nGround with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which\ncannot be reached by a Man upon a Camels Back. This Rib (says John\nLeo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their\nHistorians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesyd of Mahomet, came from\nthis Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas\nwas cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple.",
  "But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the\npresent day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are\nfound in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period\nprior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those\nbelonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier\nones.",
  "Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the\nAlabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than\nseventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,\nthat the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a\nlarge sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemens authority,\nthat Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the\ntime of capture.",
  "Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of\nsuch gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For\nPliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and\nAldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in lengthRope\nWalks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and\nSolander, Cookes naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy\nof Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or\nWrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three\nhundred and sixty feet. And Lacpde, the French naturalist, in his\nelaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page\n3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and\ntwenty-eight feet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.",
  "But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is\nas big as his ancestors in Plinys time. And if ever I go where Pliny\nis, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so.\nBecause I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies\nthat were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not\nmeasure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;\nand while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest\nEgyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they\nare drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize\ncattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the\nfattest of Pharaohs fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not\nadmit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.",
  "But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more\nrecondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient\nlook-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even\nthrough Behrings straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and\nlockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along\nall continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long\nendure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not\nat last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the\nlast man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final\npuff.",
  "Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,\nwhich, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the\nprairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and\nscowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous\nriver-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar\nan inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem\nfurnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy\nextinction.",
  "But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a\nperiod agonot a good lifetimethe census of the buffalo in Illinois\nexceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day\nnot one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the\ncause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far\ndifferent nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious\nan end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales\nfor forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank\nGod, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the\ndays of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West,\nwhen the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness\nand a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of\nmonths, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain\nnot forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need\nwere, could be statistically stated.",
  "Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the\ngradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former\nyears (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in\nsmall pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in\nconsequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more\nremunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,\ninfluenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense\ncaravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes,\nand pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but\nwidely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally\nfallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone\nwhales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with\nthem, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being\ndriven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened\nwith their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been\nvery recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.",
  "Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two\nfirm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain\nimpregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty\nSwiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas\nand glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort\nto their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers\nand walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed\ncircle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.",
  "But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one\ncachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this\npositive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.\nBut though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than\n13,000, have been annually slain on the nor west coast by the\nAmericans alone; yet there are considerations which render even this\ncircumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this\nmatter.",
  "Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness\nof the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to\nHarto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the\nKing of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are\nnumerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems\nno reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted\nfor thousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all\nthe successive monarchs of the Eastif they still survive there in\ngreat numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since\nhe has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as\nall Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the\nIsles of the sea combined.",
  "Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of\nwhales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,\ntherefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations\nmust be contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of,\nby imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of\ncreation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and\nchildren who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this\ncountless host to the present human population of the globe.",
  "Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his\nspecies, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas\nbefore the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the\nTuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noahs flood he\ndespised Noahs Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like\nthe Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will\nstill survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial\nflood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.",
  "The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel\nEnderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to\nhis own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his\nboat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when\nafter gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so\nvehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it\nwas, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough);\nthen, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and\nwrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances\nlusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.",
  "And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his\npervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the\ncondition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not\nbeen very long prior to the Pequods sailing from Nantucket, that he\nhad been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible;\nby some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his\nivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise\nsmitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme\ndifficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.",
  "Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all\nthe anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of\na former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most\npoisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as\nthe sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity,\nall miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than\nequally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief\ngo further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of\nthis: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that\nwhile some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them\nfor the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the\njoy-childlessness of all hells despair; whereas, some guilty mortal\nmiseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally\nprogressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of\nthis, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the\nthing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities\never have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at\nbottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an\narchangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the\nobvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal\nmiseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the\ngods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft\ncymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that\nthe gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad\nbirth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the\nsigners.",
  "Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more\nproperly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other\nparticulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some,\nwhy it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the\nsailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such\nGrand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought\nspeechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.\nCaptain Pelegs bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means\nadequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahabs deeper part, every\nrevelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory\nlight. But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least.\nThat direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness. And\nnot only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore,\nwho, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less banned approach\nto him; to that timid circle the above hinted casualtyremaining, as it\ndid, moodily unaccounted for by Ahabinvested itself with terrors, not\nentirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that,\nthrough their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them\nlay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it\nwas, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it\ntranspire upon the Pequods decks.",
  "And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without\ndelay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him\nsupplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which\nhad thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful\nselection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured.\nThis done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that\nnight; and to provide all the fittings for it, independent of those\npertaining to the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ships forge was\nordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and,\nto accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at\nonce to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.",
  "Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high\nabstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But\nfrom the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they\nseem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.\nBut most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of\nthe high, humane abstraction; the Pequods carpenter was no duplicate;\nhence, he now comes in person on this stage.",
  "Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging\nto whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,\nalike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his\nown; the carpenters pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk\nof all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with\nwood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of\nthe generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly\nefficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually\nrecurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years voyage, in\nuncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in\nordinary duties:repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the\nshape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bulls eyes in the deck, or new\ntree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more\ndirectly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover\nunhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both\nuseful and capricious.",
  "The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,\nwas his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several\nvices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times\nexcept when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed\nathwartships against the rear of the Try-works.",
  "A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:\nthe carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and\nstraightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage\nstrays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of\nright-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter\nmakes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the\ncarpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars\nto be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his\nbig vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the\nconstellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the\ncarpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out\npincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there;\nbut the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded\noperation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter\nsigns him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.",
  "Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent\nand without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he\ndeemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But\nwhile now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with\nsuch liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue\nsome uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For\nnothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal\nstolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the\nsurrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general\nstolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while\npauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace,\nand ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was\nthis half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an\nall-ramifying heartlessness;yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an\nold, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked\nnow and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have\nserved to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded\nforecastle of Noahs ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a\nlife-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had\ngathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small\noutward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a\nstript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born\nbabe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.\nYou might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him\ninvolved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did\nnot seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he\nhad been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or\nuneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal\nprocess. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,\nmust have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was\nlike one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, _multum in\nparvo_, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exteriorthough a little\nswelledof a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of\nvarious sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,\npens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted\nto use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open\nthat part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him\nup by the legs, and there they were.",
  "Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,\nwas, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a\ncommon soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously\ndid its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few\ndrops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it\nhad abided for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same\nunaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept\nhim a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an\nunreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his\nbody was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking\nall the time to keep himself awake.",

  "Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old\nGreek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a\nblacksmith, and animated them with fire; for whats made in fire must\nproperly belong to fire; and so hells probable. How the soot flies!\nThis must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter,\nwhen hes through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel\nshoulder-blades; theres a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.",
  "Hold; while Prometheus is about it, Ill order a complete man after a\ndesirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest\nmodelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to em, to stay\nin one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all,\nbrass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let\nme seeshall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on\ntop of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.",
  "Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good\nworkmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for\nthy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall\nnevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that\nis, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst\nthou not drive that old Adam away?",
  "Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard\nsomething curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never\nentirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still\npricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?",
  "Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing\nmay not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where\nthou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most\nsolitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, dont\nspeak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be\nnow so long dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the\nfiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!",
  "Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (_turns to go_). Oh, Life!\nHere I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this\nblockhead for a bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal\ninter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers. I would be free\nas air; and Im down in the whole worlds books. I am so rich, I could\nhave given bid for bid with the wealthiest Prtorians at the auction of\nthe Roman empire (which was the worlds); and yet I owe for the flesh\nin the tongue I brag with.

  "*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it\nis a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and\ndrench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying\nintervals, is removed by the ships pumps. Hereby the casks are sought\nto be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the\nwithdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the\nprecious cargo.",
  "Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and\nthe Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from\nthe China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a\ngeneral chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and\nanother separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the\nJapanese islandsNiphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new\nivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long\npruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, with\nhis back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his\nold courses again.",
  "And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it\nleak! Im all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky\ncasks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and thats a far\nworse plight than the Pequods, man. Yet I dont stop to plug my leak;\nfor who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it,\neven if found, in this lifes howling gale? Starbuck! Ill not have the\nBurtons hoisted.",
  "Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What\ncares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck,\nabout those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But\nlook ye, the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye,\nmy conscience is in this ships keel.On deck!",
  "Captain Ahab, said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,\nwith a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost\nseemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward\nmanifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than half\ndistrustful of itself; A better man than I might well pass over in\nthee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in\na happier, Captain Ahab.",
  "For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,\nyou would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of\nthe levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and\nas he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: Thou hast\noutraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware\nof Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab;\nbeware of thyself, old man.",
  "He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!\nmurmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. Whats that he saidAhab\nbeware of Ahabtheres something there! Then unconsciously using the\nmusket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little\ncabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and\nreturning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.",
  "It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting\nStarbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him;\nor mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously\nforbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient,\nin the important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders\nwere executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.",
  "Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold\nwere perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it\nbeing calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the\nslumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight\nsending those gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they\ngo; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost\npuncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone\ncask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted\nplacards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.\nTierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of\nstaves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the\npiled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under\nfoot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and\nrolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the\nship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head. Well was\nit that the Typhoons did not visit them then.",
  "Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;\ndignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the\nhigher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as\nharpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, butas\nwe have elsewhere seenmount his dead back in a rolling sea; and\nfinally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all\nday in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the\nclumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen,\nthe harpooneers are the holders, so called.",
  "Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should\nhave stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,\nstripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about\namid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom\nof a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor\npagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he\ncaught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after\nsome days suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill\nof the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few\nlong-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his\nframe and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his\ncheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller\nand fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but\ndeeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony\nto that immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And\nlike circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his\neyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe\nthat cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of\nthis waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any\nbeheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly\nwondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And\nthe drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all\nwith a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could\nadequately tell. So thatlet us say it againno dying Chaldee or Greek\nhad higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you\nsaw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his\nswaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his\nfinal rest, and the oceans invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and\nhigher towards his destined heaven.",
  "Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,\nwhat he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he\nasked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was\njust breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had\nchanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich\nwar-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all\nwhalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,\nand that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was\nnot unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead\nwarrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated\naway to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the\nstars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own\nmild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form\nthe white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the\nthought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual\nsea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.\nNo: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial\nto him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes\nwere without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and\nmuch lee-way adown the dim ages.",
  "Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter\nwas at once commanded to do Queequegs bidding, whatever it might\ninclude. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard,\nwhich, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal\ngroves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin\nwas recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the\norder, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent\npromptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took\nQueequegs measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequegs\nperson as he shifted the rule.",
  "Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general\nreference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the\ncoffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two\nnotches at its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his\ntools, and to work.",
  "Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people\non deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every ones\nconsternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to\nhim, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some\ndying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will\nshortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be\nindulged.",
  "Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an\nattentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock\ndrawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along\nwith one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,\nbiscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh\nwater was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up\nin the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for\na pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that\nhe might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without\nmoving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his\nlittle god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo\nbetween, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed\nover him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay\nQueequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in\nview. Rarmai (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and\nsigned to be replaced in his hammock.",
  "Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where\ngo ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where\nthe beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little\nerrand for me? Seek out one Pip, whos now been missing long: I think\nhes in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he\nmust be very sad; for look! hes left his tambourine behind;I found\nit. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and Ill beat ye your\ndying march.",
  "I have heard, murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, that in\nviolent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and\nthat when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their\nwholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken\nin their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor\nPip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers\nof all our heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?Hark! he\nspeaks again: but more wildly now.",
  "Form two and two! Lets make a General of him! Ho, wheres his\nharpoon? Lay it across here.Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game\ncock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!mind ye\nthat; Queequeg dies game!take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies\ngame! I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward;\ndied all ashiver;out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the\nAntilles hes a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he\njumped from a whale-boat! Id never beat my tambourine over base Pip,\nand hail him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame\nupon all cowardsshame upon them! Let em go drown like Pip, that\njumped from a whale-boat. Shame! shame!",
  "But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now\nthat his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon\nthere seemed no need of the carpenters box: and thereupon, when some\nexpressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the\ncause of his sudden convalescence was this;at a critical moment, he\nhad just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;\nand therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,\nhe averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter\nof his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a\nword, it was Queequegs conceit, that if a man made up his mind to\nlive, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale,\nor some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.",
  "Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;\nthat while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing,\ngenerally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.\nSo, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after\nsitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a\nvigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms\nand legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then\nspringing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,\npronounced himself fit for a fight.",
  "With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and\nemptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.\nMany spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of\ngrotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was\nstriving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on\nhis body. And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet\nand seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written\nout on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a\nmystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in\nhis own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one\nvolume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own\nlive heart beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore\ndestined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon\nthey were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought\nit must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his,\nwhen one morning turning away from surveying poor QueequegOh,\ndevilish tantalization of the gods!",
  "When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great\nSouth Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear\nPacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my\nyouth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a\nthousand leagues of blue.",
  "There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently\nawful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those\nfabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.\nJohn. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery\nprairies and Potters Fields of all four continents, the waves should\nrise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of\nmixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all\nthat we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing\nlike slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by\ntheir restlessness.",
  "To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must\never after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of\nthe world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same\nwaves wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday\nplanted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still\ngorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between\nfloat milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown\nArchipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine\nPacific zones the worlds whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to\nit; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal\nswells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.",
  "But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahabs brain, as standing like an iron\nstatue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one\nnostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles\n(in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other\nconsciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in\nwhich the hated White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at\nlength upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese\ncruising-ground, the old mans purpose intensified itself. His firm\nlips met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of his foreheads veins\nswelled like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran\nthrough the vaulted hull, Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick\nblood!",
  "Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in\nthese latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits\nshortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old\nblacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after\nconcluding his contributory work for Ahabs leg, but still retained it\non deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost\nincessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do\nsome little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their\nvarious weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an\neager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades,\npike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every\nsooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old mans was a\npatient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no\npetulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over\nstill further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil\nwere life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating\nof his heart. And so it was.Most miserable!",
  "A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing\nyawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the\ncuriosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted\nquestionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every\none now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.",
  "Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winters midnight, on the road\nrunning between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt\nthe deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,\ndilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both\nfeet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four\nacts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied\nfifth act of the grief of his lifes drama.",
  "He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly\nencountered that thing in sorrows technicals called ruin. He had been\nan artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house\nand garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three\nblithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,\nplanted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further\nconcealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into\nhis happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to\ntell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into\nhis familys heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of\nthat fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now,\nfor prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmiths shop was\nin the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so\nthat always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no\nunhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing\nof her young-armed old husbands hammer; whose reverberations, muffled\nby passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly,\nin her nursery; and so, to stout Labors iron lullaby, the blacksmiths\ninfants were rocked to slumber.",
  "Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?\nHadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came\nupon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her\norphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after\nyears; and all of them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked\ndown some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely\nhung the responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than\nuseless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him\neasier to harvest.",
  "Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew\nmore and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the\nlast; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,\nglitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows\nfell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother\ndived down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed\nher thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a\nvagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to\nflaxen curls!",
  "Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death\nis only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but\nthe first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the\nWild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of\nsuch men, who still have left in them some interior compunctions\nagainst suicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean\nalluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking\nterrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of\ninfinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to themCome hither,\nbroken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate\ndeath; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. Come\nhither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and\nabhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. Come hither! put\nup _thy_ gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till\nwe marry thee!",
  "With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about\nmid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter\nplaced upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the\ncoals, and with the other at his forges lungs, when Captain Ahab came\nalong, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While\nyet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last,\nPerth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the\nanvilthe red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,\nsome of which flew close to Ahab.",
  "Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful\nto me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others\nthat is not mad. Thou shouldst go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou\nnot go mad? How canst thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens\nyet hate thee, that thou canst not go mad?What wert thou making\nthere?",
  "Look ye here, then, cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning\nwith both hands on Perths shoulders; look ye here_here_can ye\nsmoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith, sweeping one hand across his\nribbed brow; if thou couldst, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my\nhead upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.\nAnswer! Canst thou smoothe this seam?",
  "Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for\nthough thou only seest it here in my flesh, it has worked down into\nthe bone of my skull_that_ is all wrinkles! But, away with childs\nplay; no more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here! jingling the\nleathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. I, too, want a harpoon\nmade; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth;\nsomething that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. Theres the\nstuff, flinging the pouch upon the anvil. Look ye, blacksmith, these\nare the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.",
  "I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the\nmelted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me\nfirst, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer\nthese twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick!\nIll blow the fire.",
  "This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when\nAhab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then,\nwith regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to\nhim the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge\nshooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and\nbowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or\nsome blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.",
  "No, nono water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,\nthere! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me\nas much blood as will cover this barb? holding it high up. A cluster\nof dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen\nflesh, and the White Whales barbs were then tempered.",
  "Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of\nhickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the\nsocket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some\nfathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension.\nPressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string,\nthen eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed,\nGood! and now for the seizings.",
  "At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns\nwere all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole\nwas then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope\nwas traced half-way along the poles length, and firmly secured so,\nwith intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and ropelike the\nThree Fatesremained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with\nthe weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory\npole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his\ncabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was\nheard. Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy\nstrange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the\nmelancholy ship, and mocked it!",
  "Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising\nground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,\npleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on\nthe stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or\nsailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or\nseventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small\nsuccess for their pains.",
  "At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow\nheaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so\nsociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone\ncats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy\nquietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the\noceans skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and\nwould not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a\nremorseless fang.",
  "These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a\ncertain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he\nregards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing\nonly the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high\nrolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when\nthe western emigrants horses only show their erected ears, while their\nhidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.",
  "The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these\nthere steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied\nchildren lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when\nthe flowers of the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most\nmystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate,\nand form one seamless whole.",
  "Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in\nye,though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,in ye,\nmen yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some\nfew fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them.\nWould to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling\nthreads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a\nstorm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this\nlife; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one\npause:through infancys unconscious spell, boyhoods thoughtless\nfaith, adolescence doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then\ndisbelief, resting at last in manhoods pondering repose of If. But\nonce gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and\nmen, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor\nno more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will\nnever weary? Where is the foundlings father hidden? Our souls are like\nthose orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of\nour paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.",
  "It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her\nlast cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in\nglad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,\nsailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous\nto pointing her prow for home.",
  "The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red\nbunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,\nbottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long\nlower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks\nof all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways\nlashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm;\nabove which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of\nthe same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen\nlamp.",
  "As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most\nsurprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in\nthe same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without\nsecuring a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been\ngiven away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional\nsupplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met;\nand these were stowed along the deck, and in the captains and\nofficers state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked\ninto kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an\noil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the\nforecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,\nand filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a\nhead on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged\nhis spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the\nsockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was\nfilled with sperm, except the captains pantaloons pockets, and those\nhe reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of\nhis entire satisfaction.",
  "As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the\nbarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing\nstill nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge\ntry-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin\nof the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the\nclenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and\nharpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with\nthem from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,\nfirmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long\nIsland negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were\npresiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ships\ncompany were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from\nwhich the huge pots had been removed. You would have almost thought\nthey were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they\nraised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the\nsea.",
  "And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,\nwith a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each others\nwakesone all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings\nas to things to cometheir two captains in themselves impersonated the\nwhole striking contrast of the scene.",
  "And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other\nstubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew\nof the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the\nreceding Bachelor; but the Bachelors men never heeding their gaze for\nthe lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the\ntaffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a\nsmall vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed\nthereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was\nfilled with Nantucket soundings.",
  "Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortunes favourites\nsail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the\nrushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed\nit with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,\nwhales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.",
  "It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the\ncrimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky,\nsun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and\nsuch plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy\nair, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent\nvalleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned\nsailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.",
  "Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned\noff from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the\nnow tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm\nwhales dyingthe turning sunwards of the head, and so expiringthat\nstrange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab\nconveyed a wondrousness unknown before.",
  "He turns and turns him to it,how slowly, but how steadfastly, his\nhomage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too\nworships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!Oh\nthat these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.\nLook! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in\nthese most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks\nfurnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still\nrolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the\nNigers unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith;\nbut see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it\nheads some other way.",
  "Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded\nthy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas;\nthou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the\nwide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor\nhas this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round\nagain, without a lesson to me.",
  "Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring,\nrainbowed jet!that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In\nvain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening\nsun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou,\ndarker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy\nunnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of\nonce living things, exhaled as air, but water now.",
  "The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to\nwindward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These\nlast three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one\ncould not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay\nby its side all night; and that boat was Ahabs.",
  "Ahab and all his boats crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who\ncrouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played\nround the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A\nsound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven\nghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.",
  "And when thou art so gone beforeif that ever befallthen ere I can\nfollow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?Was it not so?\nWell, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two\npledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.",
  "The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,\ncoming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would\nostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to\nthe braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed\non the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ships\nprow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon\nhigh noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was\nabout taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his\nlatitude.",
  "Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of\neffulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing\nfocus of the glassy oceans immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks\nlacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this\nnakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of\nGods throne. Well that Ahabs quadrant was furnished with coloured\nglasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging\nhis seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his\nastrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that\nposture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun\nshould gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention\nwas absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ships deck,\nand with face thrown up like Ahabs, was eyeing the same sun with him;\nonly the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was\nsubdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired\nobservation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab\nsoon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then\nfalling into a moments revery, he again looked up towards the sun and\nmurmured to himself: Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou\ntellest me truly where I _am_but canst thou cast the least hint where\nI _shall_ be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is\nthis moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be\neyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now\nbeholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding\nthe objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!",
  "Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its\nnumerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:\nFoolish toy! babies plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,\nand Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but\nwhat after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where\nthou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that\nholds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of\nwater or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy\nimpotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy;\nand cursed be all the things that cast mans eyes aloft to that heaven,\nwhose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now\nscorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earths horizon\nare the glances of mans eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as\nif God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou\nquadrant! dashing it to the deck, no longer will I guide my earthly\nway by thee; the level ships compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by\nlog and by line; _these_ shall conduct me, and show me my place on the\nsea. Aye, lighting from the boat to the deck, thus I trample on thee,\nthou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and\ndestroy thee!",
  "As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and\ndead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a\nfatalistic despair that seemed meant for himselfthese passed over the\nmute, motionless Parsees face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;\nwhile, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered\ntogether on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,\nshouted outTo the braces! Up helm!square in!",
  "I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full\nof its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,\ndown, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of\nthine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!",
  "Aye, cried Stubb, but sea-coal ashesmind ye that, Mr.\nStarbucksea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab\nmutter, Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of\nmine; swears that I must play them, and no others. And damn me, Ahab,\nbut thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!",
  "Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal\ncrouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most\neffulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows\ntornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in\nthese resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of\nall storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that\ncloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.",
  "Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and\nbare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly\nahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the\nthunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts\nfluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the\ntempest had left for its after sport.",
  "Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at\nevery flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional\ndisaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb\nand Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer\nlashing of the boats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted\nto the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahabs) did\nnot escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling\nships high teetering side, stove in the boats bottom at the stern,\nand left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.",
  "Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck, said Stubb, regarding the wreck,\nbut the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, cant fight it. You\nsee, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,\nall round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me,\nall the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But\nnever mind; its all in fun: so the old song says;(_sings_.)",
  "But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;\nand I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.\nStarbuck, theres no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my\nthroat. And when thats done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a\nwind-up.",
  "Here! cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his\nhand towards the weather bow, markest thou not that the gale comes\nfrom the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the\nvery course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where\nis that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to standhis\nstand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou\nmust!",
  "Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to\nNantucket, soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubbs\nquestion. The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it\ninto a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,\nall is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homewardI see it lightens up\nthere; but not with the lightning.",
  "Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off\nthe perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some\nships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But\nas this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may\navoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly\ntowing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering\nnot a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the\nvessels way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a\nships lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made\nin long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the\nchains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.",
  "Blast the boat! let it go! cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing\nsea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently\njammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. Blast it!but slipping\nbackward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and\nimmediately shifting his tone he criedThe corpusants have mercy on us\nall!",
  "To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of\nthe calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses\nfrom the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething\nsea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when\nGods burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His Mene, Mene,\nTekel Upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.",
  "While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the\nenchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all\ntheir eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away\nconstellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the\ngigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and\nseemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted\nmouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely\ngleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by\nthe preternatural light, Queequegs tattooing burned like Satanic blue\nflames on his body.",
  "The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more\nthe Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment\nor two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.\nIt was Stubb. What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not\nthe same in the song.",
  "No, no, it wasnt; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I\nhope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?have\nthey no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuckbut its too dark\nto look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign\nof good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be\nchock a block with sperm-oil, dye see; and so, all that sperm will\nwork up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will\nyet be as three spermaceti candlesthats the good promise we saw.",
  "At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,\nthe Parsee was kneeling in Ahabs front, but with his head bowed away\nfrom him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where\nthey had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,\narrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a\nknot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various\nenchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running\nskeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all\ntheir eyes upcast.",
  "Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian\nonce did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that\nto this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I\nnow know that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor\nreverence wilt thou be kind; and een for hate thou canst but kill; and\nall are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,\nplaceless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will\ndispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of\nthe personified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a\npoint at best; whencesoeer I came; wheresoeer I go; yet while I\nearthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal\nrights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of\nlove, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere\nsupernal power; and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted\nworlds, theres that in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou\nclear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of\nfire, I breathe it back to thee.",
  "I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung\nfrom me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can\nthen grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the\nhomage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The\nlightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my\nwhole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning\nground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though\nthou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of\nlight, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?\nThere burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my\ngenealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know\nnot. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but\nthine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself\nunbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself\nunbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou\nomnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear\nspirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness\nmechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly\nsee it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast\nthy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with\nhaughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap\nwith thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly\nI worship thee!",
  "Ahabs harpoon, the one forged at Perths fire, remained firmly lashed\nin its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boats\nbow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather\nsheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a\nlevelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there\nlike a serpents tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the armGod, God is\nagainst thee, old man; forbear! tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill\ncontinued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a\nfair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.",
  "Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the\nbracesthough not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast\nmates thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But\ndashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the\nburning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to\ntransfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a ropes end.\nPetrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart\nthat he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:",
  "All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and\nheart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye\nmay know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out\nthe last fear! And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the\nflame.",
  "As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of\nsome lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it\nso much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for\nthunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahabs many of the mariners did\nrun from him in a terror of dismay.",
  "Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises,\nbut it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.By\nmasts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some\ncoasting smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest\ntrucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now\nsails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards\nsend down their brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh aloft\nthere! I would een take it for sublime, did I not know that the colic\nis a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!",
  "No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but\nyou will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how\nlong ago is it since you said the very contrary? Didnt you once say\nthat whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra\non its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder\nbarrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didnt you say\nso?",
  "Well, suppose I did? What then? Ive part changed my flesh since that\ntime, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we _are_ loaded with powder\nbarrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get\nafire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty\nred hair, but you couldnt get afire now. Shake yourself; youre\nAquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat\ncollar. Dont you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine\nInsurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask.\nBut hark, again, and Ill answer ye the other thing. First take your\nleg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the\nrope; now listen. Whats the mighty difference between holding a masts\nlightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasnt\ngot any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Dont you see, you\ntimber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the\nmast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in\na hundred carries rods, and Ahab,aye, man, and all of us,were in no\nmore danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten\nthousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose\nyou would have every man in the world go about with a small\nlightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia\nofficers skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why\ndont ye be sensible, Flask? its easy to be sensible; why dont ye,\nthen? any man with half an eye can be sensible.",
  "Yes, when a fellows soaked through, its hard to be sensible, thats\na fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the\nturn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors\nnow as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two\nanchors here, Flask, seems like tying a mans hands behind him. And\nwhat big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron\nfists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the\nworld is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long\ncable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and weve done. So; next\nto touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say,\njust wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at\nlong-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a long tailed coat ought always\nto be worn in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way,\nserve to carry off the water, dye see. Same with cocked hats; the\ncocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and\ntarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a\nbeaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord,\nLord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!\nThis is a nasty night, lad.",
  "In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock\nto the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the\ncompasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the\nPequods; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice\nthe whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a\nsight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted\nemotion.",
  "Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the\nstrenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubbone engaged forward and the\nother aftthe shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails\nwere cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like\nthe feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds\nwhen that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.",
  "The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a\nstorm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through\nthe water with some precision again; and the coursefor the present,\nEast-south-eastwhich he was to steer, if practicable, was once more\ngiven to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only\nsteered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the\nship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile,\nlo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul\nbreeze became fair!",
  "In compliance with the standing order of his commanderto report\nimmediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided\nchange in the affairs of the deck,Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the\nyards to the breezehowever reluctantly and gloomily,than he\nmechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.",
  "Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a\nmoment. The cabin lamptaking long swings this way and thatwas burning\nfitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old mans bolted door,a\nthin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper panels. The\nisolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence\nto reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the\nelements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as\nthey stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an\nhonest, upright man; but out of Starbucks heart, at that instant when\nhe saw the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so\nblent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he\nhardly knew it for itself.",
  "He would have shot me once, he murmured, yes, theres the very\nmusket that he pointed at me;that one with the studded stock; let me\ntouch itlift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly\nlances, strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye,\naye; and powder in the pan;thats not good. Best spill it?wait. Ill\ncure myself of this. Ill hold the musket boldly while I think.I come\nto report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and\ndoom,_thats_ fair for Moby Dick. Its a fair wind thats only fair\nfor that accursed fish.The very tube he pointed at me!the very one;\n_this_ oneI hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing\nI handle now.Aye and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say\nhe will not strike his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his\nheavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his\nway by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very\nTyphoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But\nshall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ships\ncompany down to doom with him?Yes, it would make him the wilful\nmurderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm;\nand come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have\nhis way. If, then, he were this instantput aside, that crime would not\nbe his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,in there,\nhes sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I\ncant withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance;\nnot entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat\nobedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye,\nand sayst the men have vowd thy vow; sayst all of us are Ahabs.\nGreat God forbid!But is there no other way? no lawful way?Make him a\nprisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old mans living\npower from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were\npinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to\nring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged\ntiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his\nhowlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me\non the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is\nhundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone\nhere upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me\nand law.Aye, aye, tis so.Is heaven a murderer when its lightning\nstrikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin\ntogether?And would I be a murderer, then, ifand slowly, stealthily,\nand half sideways looking, he placed the loaded muskets end against\nthe door.",
  "On this level, Ahabs hammock swings within; his head this way. A\ntouch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.Oh\nMary! Mary!boy! boy! boy!But if I wake thee not to death, old man,\nwho can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbucks body this day week may\nsink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou? Shall I? shall\nI?The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails\nare reefed and set; she heads her course.",
  "Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of\nmighty bulk, and striving in the Pequods gurgling track, pushed her on\nlike giants palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded\nso, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world\nboomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the\ninvisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place;\nwhere his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned\nBabylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a\ncrucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.",
  "Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time\nthe tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to\neye the bright suns rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly\nsettled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the suns rearward\nplace, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating\nwake.",
  "Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than\none case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as\ndeveloped in the mariners needle, is, as all know, essentially one\nwith the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much\nmarvelled at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning\nhas actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars\nand rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more\nfatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before\nmagnetic steel was of no more use than an old wifes knitting needle.\nBut in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the\noriginal virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be\naffected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;\neven were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.",
  "Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed\ncompasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took\nthe precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were\nexactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ships course to be\nchanged accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod\nthrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair\none had only been juggling her.",
  "Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said\nnothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and\nFlaskwho in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his\nfeelingslikewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some\nof them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear\nof Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost\nwholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain\nmagnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahabs.",
  "Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about\nto do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to\nrevive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a\nmatter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old\nman well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily\npracticable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious\nsailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.",
  "With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the\nlance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade\nhim hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the\nmaul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he\nplaced the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly\nhammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before.\nThen going through some small strange motions with itwhether\nindispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to\naugment the awe of the crew, is uncertainhe called for linen thread;\nand moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there,\nand horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of\nthe compass-cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering\nand vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when\nAhab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly\nback from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it,\nexclaimed,Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level\nloadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!",
  "While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log\nand line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance\nupon other means of determining the vessels place, some merchantmen,\nand many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave\nthe log; though at the same time, and frequently more for forms sake\nthan anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the\ncourse steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of\nprogression every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden\nreel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the\nrailing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and\nwind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that\nhung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he\nhappened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet\nscene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his\nfrantic oath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing\nplungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.",
  "In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, its good. Heres a man\nfrom Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;\nwhich is sucked inby what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall\nbutts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.",
  "Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pips missing.\nLets see now if ye havent fished him up here, fisherman. It drags\nhard; I guess hes holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul\nin no cowards here. Ho! theres his arm just breaking water. A hatchet!\na hatchet! cut it offwe haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir,\nsir! heres Pip, trying to get on board again.",
  "There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens!\nlook down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned\nhim, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahabs cabin shall be Pips\nhome henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy;\nthou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, lets\ndown.",
  "Whats this? heres velvet shark-skin, intently gazing at Ahabs\nhand, and feeling it. Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing\nas this, perhaps he had neer been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a\nman-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth\nnow come and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the\nwhite, for I will not let this go.",
  "Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse\nhorrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in\ngods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods\noblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not\nwhat he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come!\nI feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an\nEmperors!",
  "Steering now south-eastward by Ahabs levelled steel, and her progress\nsolely determined by Ahabs level log and line; the Pequod held on her\npath towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such\nunfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways\nimpelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all\nthese seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and\ndesperate scene.",
  "At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the\nEquatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before\nthe dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watchthen\nheaded by Flaskwas startled by a cry so plaintively wild and\nunearthlylike half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herods\nmurdered Innocentsthat one and all, they started from their reveries,\nand for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all\ntransfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild\ncry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the\ncrew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers\nremained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxmanthe oldest mariner of\nalldeclared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the\nvoices of newly drowned men in the sea.",
  "Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great\nnumbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or\nsome dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and\nkept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of\nwail. But this only the more affected some of them, because most\nmariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not\nonly from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the\nhuman look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen\npeeringly uprising from the water alongside. In the sea, under certain\ncircumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.",
  "But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\nconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At\nsun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;\nand whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for\nsailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus\nwith the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had\nnot been long at his perch, when a cry was hearda cry and a\nrushingand looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and\nlooking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the\nsea.",
  "The life-buoya long slender caskwas dropped from the stern, where it\nalways hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,\nand the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it\nslowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore; and\nthe studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to\nyield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.",
  "And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out\nfor the White Whale, on the White Whales own peculiar ground; that man\nwas swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the\ntime. Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at\nleast as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of\nevil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged.\nThey declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they\nhad heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.",
  "The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see\nto it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in\nthe feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the\nvoyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly\nconnected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be;\ntherefore, they were going to leave the ships stern unprovided with a\nbuoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a\nhint concerning his coffin.",
  "He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he\nbaulks. Now I dont like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he\nwears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he\nwont put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with\nthat coffin? And now Im ordered to make a life-buoy of it. Its like\nturning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I\ndont like this cobbling sort of businessI dont like it at all; its\nundignified; its not my place. Let tinkers brats do tinkerings; we\nare their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,\nfair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at\nthe beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at\nthe conclusion; not a cobblers job, thats at an end in the middle,\nand at the beginning at the end. Its the old womans tricks to be\ngiving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for\ntinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a\nbald-headed young tinker once. And thats the reason I never would work\nfor lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the\nVineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run\noff with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let\nme see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with\npitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over\nthe ships stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some\nsuperstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere\nthey would do the job. But Im made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I\ndont budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard\ntray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and\ncard-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or\nby the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore\nof our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it\nif we can. Hem! Ill do the job, now, tenderly. Ill have melets\nseehow many in the ships company, all told? But Ive forgotten. Any\nway, Ill have me thirty separate, Turks-headed life-lines, each three\nfeet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down,\ntherell be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight\nnot seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron,\npitch-pot, and marling-spike! Lets to it.",
  "Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,\nmonopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the\nnext day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those\nsame coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a\njack-of-all-trades.",
  "Aye, and thats because the lid theres a sounding-board; and what in\nall things makes the sounding-board is thistheres naught beneath. And\nyet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter.\nHast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against\nthe churchyard gate, going in?",
  "He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot\nlatitudes. Ive heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the\nGallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me some\nsort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. Hes always\nunder the Linefiery hot, I tell ye! Hes looking this waycome, oakum;\nquick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and Im the\nprofessor of musical glassestap, tap!",
  "Theres a sight! Theres a sound! The greyheaded woodpecker tapping\nthe hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See! that\nthing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag,\nthat fellow. Rat-tat! So mans seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all\nmaterials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here\nnows the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the\nexpressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A\nlife-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some\nspiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver!\nIll think of that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth,\nthat its other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain\ntwilight to me. Will ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed\nsound? I go below; let me not see that thing here when I return again.\nNow, then, Pip, well talk this over; I do suck most wondrous\nphilosophies from thee! Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds\nmust empty into thee!",
  "Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down\nupon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time\nthe Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the\nbroad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all\nfell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from\nthe smitten hull.",
  "Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;\nand would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger\ncaptain himself, having stopped his vessels way, was seen descending\nher side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the\nPequods main-chains, and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was\nrecognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation\nwas exchanged.",
  "It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,\nwhile three of the strangers boats were engaged with a shoal of\nwhales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and\nwhile they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head\nof Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to\nleeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boata reserved onehad been\ninstantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this\nfourth boatthe swiftest keeled of allseemed to have succeeded in\nfasteningat least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell\nanything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;\nand then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing\nmore; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have\nindefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was\nsome apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals\nwere placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her\nthree far to windward boatsere going in quest of the fourth one in the\nprecisely opposite directionthe ship had not only been necessitated to\nleave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to\nincrease her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last\nsafe aboard, she crowded all sailstunsail on stunsailafter the\nmissing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every\nother man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a\nsufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when\nlast seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all\naround her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again\npaused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing\ntill daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been\nseen.",
  "The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his\nobject in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his\nown in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles\napart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.",
  "I will wager something now, whispered Stubb to Flask, that some one\nin that missing boat wore off that Captains best coat; mayhap, his\nwatchhes so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two\npious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height\nof the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he lookspale in\nthe very buttons of his eyeslookit wasnt the coatit must have been\nthe",
  "My boy, my own boy is among them. For Gods sakeI beg, I\nconjurehere exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had\nbut icily received his petition. For eight-and-forty hours let me\ncharter your shipI will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for itif\nthere be no other wayfor eight-and-forty hours onlyonly thatyou\nmust, oh, you must, and you _shall_ do this thing.",
  "Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachels\nthe more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the\nCaptains sons among the number of the missing boats crew; but among\nthe number of the other boats crews, at the same time, but on the\nother hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the\nchase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the\nwretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;\nwhich was only solved for him by his chief mates instinctively\nadopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,\nthat is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to\npick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown\nconstitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not\ntill forced to it by Ahabs iciness did he allude to his one yet\nmissing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the\nearnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketers paternal love, had\nthus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a\nvocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it\nunfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such\ntender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years voyage\nin some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a\nwhalemans career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a\nfathers natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and\nconcern.",
  "I will not go, said the stranger, till you say _aye_ to me. Do to me\nas you would have me do to you in the like case. For _you_ too have a\nboy, Captain Ahabthough but a child, and nestling safely at home nowa\nchild of your old age tooYes, yes, you relent; I see itrun, run, men,\nnow, and stand by to square in the yards.",
  "Avast, cried Ahabtouch not a rope-yarn; then in a voice that\nprolongingly moulded every wordCaptain Gardiner, I will not do it.\nEven now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I\nforgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle\nwatch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all\nstrangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.",
  "Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel\nwas in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,\nhowever small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung\nround; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat\nagainst a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the\nwhile, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three\ntall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.",
  "Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is\ncoming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee\nby him. There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my\nmalady. Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most\ndesired health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee,\nas if thou wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own\nscrewed chair; another screw to it, thou must be.",
  "Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.\nListen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still\nknow that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!Met! True art\nthou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless\nthee; and if it come to that,God for ever save thee, let what will\nbefall.",
  "Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,but Im alone. Now\nwere even poor Pip here I could endure it, but hes missing. Pip! Pip!\nDing, dong, ding! Whos seen Pip? He must be up here; lets try the\ndoor. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet theres no opening\nit. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me\nthis screwed chair was mine. Here, then, Ill seat me, against the\ntransom, in the ships full middle, all her keel and her three masts\nbefore me. Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours\ngreat admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of\ncaptains and lieutenants. Ha! whats this? epaulets! epaulets! the\nepaulets all come crowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye;\nfill up, monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now, when a black boys host\nto white men with gold lace upon their coats!Monsieurs, have ye seen\none Pip?a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and\ncowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat once;seen him? No! Well then, fill\nup again, captains, and lets drink shame upon all cowards! I name no\nnames. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon the table. Shame upon all\ncowards.Hist! above there, I hear ivoryOh, master! master! I am\nindeed down-hearted when you walk over me. But here Ill stay, though\nthis stern strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to\njoin me.",
  "And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a\npreliminary cruise, Ahab,all other whaling waters sweptseemed to have\nchased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there;\nnow, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude\nwhere his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had\nbeen spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered\nMoby Dick;and now that all his successive meetings with various ships\ncontrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which\nthe white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against;\nnow it was that there lurked a something in the old mans eyes, which\nit was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting\npolar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months night\nsustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahabs purpose now\nfixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It\ndomineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,\nfears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a\nsingle spear or leaf.",
  "In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,\nvanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more\nstrove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed\nground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped\nmortar of Ahabs iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the\ndeck, ever conscious that the old mans despot eye was on them.",
  "But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when\nhe thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that\neven as Ahabs eyes so awed the crews, the inscrutable Parsees glance\nawed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.\nSuch an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah\nnow; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious\nat him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal\nsubstance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen\nbeings body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by\nnight, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go\nbelow. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan\nbut wondrous eyes did plainly sayWe two watchmen never rest.",
  "Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the\ndeck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole,\nor exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,the\nmain-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the\ncabin-scuttle,his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step;\nhis hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he\nstood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung\nin his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never\ntell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at\ntimes; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter,\nthough he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and\nthe unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved\ncoat and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next days\nsunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night;\nhe went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin\nthat thing he sent for.",
  "He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,breakfast and\ndinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly\ngrew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still\ngrow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But\nthough his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the\nParsees mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these\ntwo never seemed to speakone man to the otherunless at long intervals\nsome passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent\nspell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck\ncrew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak\none word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the\nslightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a\nsingle hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his\nscuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each\nother; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the\nParsee his abandoned substance.",
  "And yet, somehow, did Ahabin his own proper self, as daily, hourly,\nand every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,Ahab\nseemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both\nseemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean\nshade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and\nkeel was solid Ahab.",
  "But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the\nchildren-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac\nold man seemed distrustful of his crews fidelity; at least, of nearly\nall except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether\nStubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But\nif these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from\nverbally expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.",
  "I will have the first sight of the whale myself,he said. Aye! Ahab\nmust have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest of\nbasketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved\nblock, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the\ndownward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin\nfor the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with\nthat end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round\nupon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long\nupon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then\nsettling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,Take the\nrope, sirI give it into thy hands, Starbuck. Then arranging his\nperson in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his\nperch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and\nafterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the\nroyal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,ahead,\nastern, this side, and that,within the wide expanded circle commanded\nat so great a height.",
  "When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in\nthe rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is\nhoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these\ncircumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict\ncharge to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such\na wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations\naloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at\nthe deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few\nminutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural\nfatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor\nshould by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all\nswooping to the sea. So Ahabs proceedings in this matter were not\nunusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck,\nalmost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with\nanything in the slightest degree approaching to decisionone of those\ntoo, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt\nsomewhat;it was strange, that this was the very man he should select\nfor his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise\ndistrusted persons hands.",
  "Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten\nminutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly\nincommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\nlatitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\nhead in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a\nthousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and\nwent eddying again round his head.",
  "But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\nnot to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked\nit much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least\nheedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every\nsight.",
  "An eagle flew thrice round Tarquins head, removing his cap to replace\nit, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be\nking of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen\naccounted good. Ahabs hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on\nand on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared;\nwhile from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was\ndimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.",
  "The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the\nlife-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably\nmisnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were\nfixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some\nwhaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine\nfeet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.",
  "Not forged! and snatching Perths levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab\nheld it out, exclaimingLook ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold\nhis death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these\nbarbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the\nfin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!",
  "Then God keep thee, old manseest thou thatpointing to the\nhammockI bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only\nyesterday; but were dead ere night. Only _that_ one I bury; the rest\nwere buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb. Then turning\nto his crewAre ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and\nlift the body; so, thenOh! Godadvancing towards the hammock with\nuplifted handsmay the resurrection and the life",
  "It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were\nhardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was\ntransparently pure and soft, with a womans look, and the robust and\nman-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samsons\nchest in his sleep.",
  "Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,\nunspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;\nbut to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed\nmighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,\ntroubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.",
  "Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle\nair to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the\ngirdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motionmost seen\nhere at the equatordenoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving\nalarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.",
  "Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm\nand unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the\nashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the\nmorn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girls\nforehead of heaven.",
  "Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged\ncreatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how\noblivious were ye of old Ahabs close-coiled woe! But so have I seen\nlittle Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around\ntheir old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on\nthe marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.",
  "Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side\nand watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the\nmore and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the\nlovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a\nmoment, the cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that\nwinsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world,\nso long cruelforbiddingnow threw affectionate arms round his stubborn\nneck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that\nhowever wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save\nand to bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into\nthe sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee\ndrop.",
  "Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;\nand he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing\nthat stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to\ntouch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood\nthere.",
  "Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such\na dayvery much such a sweetness as thisI struck my first whalea\nboy-harpooneer of eighteen! Fortyfortyforty years ago!ago! Forty\nyears of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and\nstorm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab\nforsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors\nof the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not\nspent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the\ndesolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a\nCaptains exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any\nsympathy from the green country withoutoh, weariness! heaviness!\nGuinea-coast slavery of solitary command!when I think of all this;\nonly half-suspected, not so keenly known to me beforeand how for forty\nyears I have fed upon dry salted farefit emblem of the dry nourishment\nof my soil!when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily\nhand, and broken the worlds fresh bread to my mouldy crustsaway,\nwhole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and\nsailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage\npillowwife? wife?rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I\nwidowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the\nmadness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with\nwhich, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly\nchased his preymore a demon than a man!aye, aye! what a forty years\nfoolfoolold fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase?\nwhy weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?\nhow the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not\nhard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been\nsnatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me,\nthat I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some\nashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel\ndeadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering\nbeneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!crack my\nheart!stave my brain!mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey\nhairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus\nintolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a\nhuman eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to\ngaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is\nthe magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;\nstay on board, on board!lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives\nchase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with\nthe far away home I see in that eye!",
  "Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!\nwhy should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us\nfly these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are\nStarbuckswife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow\nyouth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,\nlonging, paternal old age! Away! let us away!this instant let me alter\nthe course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl\non our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some\nsuch mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.",
  "They have, they have. I have seen themsome summer days in the\nmorning. About this timeyes, it is his noon nap nowthe boy\nvivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of\ncannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back\nto dance him again.",
  "Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every\nmorning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of\nhis fathers sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for\nNantucket! Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away!\nSee, see! the boys face from the window! the boys hand on the hill!",
  "What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what\ncozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor\ncommands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep\npushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly\nmaking me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not\nso much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this\narm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy\nin heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible\npower; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain\nthink thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does\nthat living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round\nin this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all\nthe time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon\nAlbicore! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where\ndo murderers go, man! Whos to doom, when the judge himself is dragged\nto the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and\nthe air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have\nbeen making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and\nthe mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we\nhow we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust\namid greenness; as last years scythes flung down, and left in the\nhalf-cut swathsStarbuck!",
  "That night, in the mid-watch, when the old manas his wont at\nintervalsstepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went\nto his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing\nup the sea air as a sagacious ships dog will, in drawing nigh to some\nbarbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that\npeculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living\nsperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner\nsurprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane,\nand then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as\npossible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ships course to be slightly\naltered, and the sail to be shortened.",
  "The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated\nat daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and\nlengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery\nwrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift\ntide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.",
  "All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for\nswaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were\nhoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and\nwhile peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the\nmain-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the\nair. There she blows!there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is\nMoby Dick!",
  "Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\nlook-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\nwhale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final\nperch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\nbeneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indians\nhead was almost on a level with Ahabs heel. From this height the whale\nwas now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing\nhis high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into\nthe air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they\nhad so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.",
  "Not the same instant; not the sameno, the doubloon is mine, Fate\nreserved the doubloon for me. _I_ only; none of ye could have raised\nthe White Whale first. There she blows!there she blows!there she\nblows! There again!there again! he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,\nmethodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whales\nvisible jets. Hes going to sound! In stunsails! Down\ntop-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay\non board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;\nsteady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All\nready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck;\nlower, lower,quick, quicker! and he slid through the air to the deck.",
  "Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;\nbut only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew\nstill more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a\nnoon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter\ncame so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling\nhump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated\nthing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,\ngreenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly\nprojecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged\nwaters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky\nforehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and\nbehind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving\nvalley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and\ndanced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of\nhundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their\nfitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull\nof an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected\nfrom the white whales back; and at intervals one of the cloud of\nsoft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over\nthe fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail\nfeathers streaming like pennons.",
  "A gentle joyousnessa mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\nthe gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\nravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering\neyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,\nrippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that\ngreat majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\ndivinely swam.",
  "On each soft sidecoincident with the parted swell, that but once\nleaving him, then flowed so wide awayon each bright side, the whale\nshed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\nnamelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured\nto assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\ntornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all\nwho for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way\nthou mayst have bejuggled and destroyed before.",
  "And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\nwaves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby\nDick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his\nsubmerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.\nBut soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an\ninstant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginias\nNatural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,\nthe grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.\nHoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls\nlongingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.",
  "An hour, said Ahab, standing rooted in his boats stern; and he gazed\nbeyond the whales place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\nvacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\nwhirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze\nnow freshened; the sea began to swell.",
  "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now\nall flying towards Ahabs boat; and when within a few yards began\nfluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,\nexpectant cries. Their vision was keener than mans; Ahab could\ndiscover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down\ninto its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a\nwhite weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it\nrose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long\ncrooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\nundiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dicks open mouth and scrolled jaw;\nhis vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.\nThe glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\ntomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled\nthe craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon\nFedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and\nseizing Perths harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\nstand by to stern.",
  "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\nits bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whales head while yet\nunder water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that\nmalicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\nhimself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\nlengthwise beneath the boat.",
  "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for\nan instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a\nbiting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\nmouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\nthe open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish\npearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahabs\nhead, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale\nnow shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\nunastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\ntiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each others heads to gain the\nuttermost stern.",
  "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\nwhale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\nbody being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from\nthe bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while\nthe other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\nimpossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with\nthis tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\nhelpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\nthe long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from\nits gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the\nfrail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\nenormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in\ntwain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the\ntwo floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the\ncrew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold\nfast to the oars to lash them across.",
  "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first\nto perceive the whales intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\nmovement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had\nmade one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only\nslipping further into the whales mouth, and tilting over sideways as\nit slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him\nout of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the\nsea.",
  "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\ndistance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\nbillows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;\nso that when his vast wrinkled forehead rosesome twenty or more feet\nout of the waterthe now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,\ndazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray\nstill higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel\nbillows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to\noverleap its summit with their scud.",
  "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\nand round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\nwake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly\nassault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the\nblood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochuss elephants in the\nbook of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the\nwhales insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,though he\ncould still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;\nhelpless Ahabs head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least\nchance shock might burst. From the boats fragmentary stern, Fedallah\nincuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other\ndrifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to\nlook to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whales\naspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,\nthat he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other\nboats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into\nthe eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\ndestruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\ncase could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,\nthey remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had\nnow become the old mans head.",
  "Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ships\nmast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;\nand was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!Sail on\nthebut that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and\nwhelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing\nto rise on a towering crest, he shouted,Sail on the whale!Drive him\noff!",
  "Dragged into Stubbs boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\nbrine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahabs bodily\nstrength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his bodys doom: for a\ntime, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubbs boat, like one trodden\nunder foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from\nhim, as desolate sounds from out ravines.",
  "But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\nabbreviate it. In an instants compass, great hearts sometimes condense\nto one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\nthrough feebler mens whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary\nin each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time\naggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous\nintensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures\ncontain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.",
  "It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked\nup by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is\nthus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now.\nBut the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the\nwhale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with\na velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these\ncircumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely\nprolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long\na period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing\nbarely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself,\nthen, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate\nmeans of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her,\nand were soon swayed up to their cranesthe two parts of the wrecked\nboat having been previously secured by herand then hoisting everything\nto her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways\noutstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an\nalbatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At\nthe well known, methodic intervals, the whales glittering spout was\nregularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be\nreported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing\nthe deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\nallotted hour expired, his voice was heard.Whose is the doubloon now?\nDye see him? and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded\nthem to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now\naloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.",
  "As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men\naloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a\nstill greater breadththus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat,\nat every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped\nupon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered\nstern. At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded\nsky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old\nmans face there now stole some such added gloom as this.",
  "Omen? omen?the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to\nman, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and\ngive an old wives darkling hint.Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles\nof one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye\ntwo are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the\npeopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, coldI shiver!How\nnow? Aloft there! Dye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he\nspout ten times a second!",
  "Good! he will travel slower now tis night. Down royals and\ntop-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before\nmorning; hes making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm\nthere! keep her full before the wind!Aloft! come down!Mr. Stubb, send\na fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till\nmorning.Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mastMen,\nthis gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till\nthe White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,\nupon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that mans; and if on\nthat day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be\ndivided among all of ye! Away now!the deck is thine, sir!",
  "Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular\nwhale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is\na thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is\nthe wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible\nconfidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket\ncommanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last\ndescried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty\naccurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to\nswim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of\nprogression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a\npilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he\nwell knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at\nsome further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes\nthe precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more\ncertainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be\nvisited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for\nafter being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of\ndaylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creatures future\nwake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious\nmind of the hunter, as the pilots coast is to him. So that to this\nhunters wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in\nwater, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the\nsteadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway\nis so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their\nhands, men time his rate as doctors that of a babys pulse; and lightly\nsay of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a\nspot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions\nwhen these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,\naccording to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so\nmany hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have\nabout reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to\nrender this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the\nsea must be the whalemans allies; for of what present avail to the\nbecalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is\nexactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable\nfrom these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the\nchase of whales.",
  "By salt and hemp! cried Stubb, but this swift motion of the deck\ncreeps up ones legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two\nbrave fellows!Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,\non the sea,for by live-oaks! my spines a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait\nthat leaves no dust behind!",
  "And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies\nof the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine\nworked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\nhave felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the\ngrowing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,\nas timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand\nof Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the\nprevious day; the rack of the past nights suspense; the fixed,\nunfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging\ntowards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled\nalong. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\nvessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of\nthat unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.",
  "They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;\nthough it was put together of all contrasting thingsoak, and maple,\nand pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hempyet all these ran into each\nother in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced\nand directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities\nof the crew, this mans valor, that mans fear; guilt and guiltiness,\nall varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that\nfatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.",
  "The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\nhand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,\nshading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking\nyards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for\ntheir fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to\nseek out the thing that might destroy them!",
  "It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some\nother thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for\nhardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its\npin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the\nair vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant\nhalloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, asmuch nearer to the ship\nthan the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile aheadMoby Dick\nbodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not\nby the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the\nWhite Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous\nphenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the\nfurthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the\npure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows\nhis place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,\nthe torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,\nthis breaching is his act of defiance.",
  "There she breaches! there she breaches! was the cry, as in his\nimmeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\nHeaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\nagainst the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\nfor the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\nstood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\nintensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.",
  "As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\nassailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the\nthree crews. Ahabs boat was central; and cheering his men, he told\nthem he would take the whale head-and-head,that is, pull straight up\nto his forehead,a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,\nsuch a course excludes the coming onset from the whales sidelong\nvision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three\nboats were plain as the ships three masts to his eye; the White Whale\nchurning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,\nrushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered\nappalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him\nfrom every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank\nof which those boats were made. But skilfully manuvred, incessantly\nwheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while\neluded him; though, at times, but by a planks breadth; while all the\ntime, Ahabs unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.",
  "But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\nand recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three\nlines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,\nwarped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now\nfor a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more\ntremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\nline: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it againhoping\nthat way to disencumber it of some snarlswhen lo!a sight more savage\nthan the embattled teeth of sharks!",
  "Caught and twistedcorkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons\nand lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing\nand dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahabs boat. Only one\nthing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\nwithinthroughand then, withoutthe rays of steel; dragged in the line\nbeyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering\nthe rope near the chocksdropped the intercepted fagot of steel into\nthe sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a\nsudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so\ndoing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask\ntowards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a\nsurf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a\nboiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of\nthe wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\nstirred bowl of punch.",
  "While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\nthe revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\naslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching\nhis legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was\nlustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old\nmans linenow partingadmitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\nrescue whom he could;in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\nconcreted perils,Ahabs yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\nHeaven by invisible wires,as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly\nfrom the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its\nbottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\nagaingunwale downwardsand Ahab and his men struggled out from under\nit, like seals from a sea-side cave.",
  "The first uprising momentum of the whalemodifying its direction as he\nstruck the surfaceinvoluntarily launched him along it, to a little\ndistance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his\nback to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from\nside to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or\ncrumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and\ncame sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work\nfor that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the\nocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\nleeward way at a travellers methodic pace.",
  "As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\ncame bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\nfloating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\nand safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,\nand ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\ninextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these\nwere there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen\nany one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly\nclinging to his boats broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy\nfloat; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous days mishap.",
  "But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\ninstead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\nStarbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory\nleg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.",
  "Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!dye see it.But even with a\nbroken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of\nmine one jot more me, than this dead one thats lost. Nor white whale,\nnor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and\ninaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape\nyonder roof?Aloft there! which way?",
  "_My_ line! _my_ line? Gone?gone? What means that little word?What\ndeath-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.\nThe harpoon, too!toss over the litter there,dye see it?the forged\niron, men, the white whalesno, no, no,blistered fool! this hand did\ndart it!tis in the fish!Aloft there! Keep him nailedQuick!all\nhands to the rigging of the boatscollect the oarsharpooneers! the\nirons, the irons!hoist the royals highera pull on all the\nsheets!helm there! steady, steady for your life! Ill ten times girdle\nthe unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it, but Ill slay\nhim yet!",
  "Great God! but for one single instant show thyself, cried Starbuck;\nnever, never wilt thou capture him, old manIn Jesus name no more of\nthis, thats worse than devils madness. Two days chased; twice stove\nto splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil\nshadow goneall good angels mobbing thee with warnings:what more\nwouldst thou have?Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he\nswamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the\nsea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,Impiety\nand blasphemy to hunt him more!",
  "Starbuck, of late Ive felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that\nhour we both sawthou knowst what, in one anothers eyes. But in this\nmatter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this\nhanda lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This\nwhole acts immutably decreed. Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion\nyears before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates lieutenant; I act\nunder orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.Stand round\nme, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered\nlance; propped up on a lonely foot. Tis Ahabhis bodys part; but\nAhabs souls a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel\nstrained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a\ngale; and I may look so. But ere I break, yell hear me crack; and till\nye hear _that_, know that Ahabs hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe\nye, men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!\nFor ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface;\nthen rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dicktwo days hes\nfloatedtomorrow will be the third. Aye, men, hell rise once more,but\nonly to spout his last! Dye feel brave men, brave?",
  "And as mechanical, muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he\nmuttered on: The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same\nto Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek\nto drive out of others hearts whats clinched so fast in mine!The\nParseethe Parsee!gone, gone? and he was to go before:but still was\nto be seen again ere I could perishHows that?Theres a riddle now\nmight baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of\njudges:like a hawks beak it pecks my brain. _Ill_, _Ill_ solve it,\nthough!",
  "So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on\nthe previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the\ngrindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by\nlanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and\nsharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken\nkeel of Ahabs wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while\nstill as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his\nscuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its\ndial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.",
  "In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, thats all. Helm\nthere; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day\nagain! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the\nangels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a\nfairer day could not dawn upon that world. Heres food for thought, had\nAhab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels;\n_thats_ tingling enough for mortal man! to thinks audacity. God only\nhas that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness\nand a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too\nmuch for that. And yet, Ive sometimes thought my brain was very\ncalmfrozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the\ncontents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing\nnow; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, its like\nthat sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy\nclefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow\nit; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the\ntossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this\nthrough prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and\nventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.\nOut upon it!its tainted. Were I the wind, Id blow no more on such a\nwicked, miserable world. Id crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink\nthere. And yet, tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever\nconquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow. Run\ntilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that\nstrikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.\nEven Ahab is a braver thinga nobler thing than _that_. Would now the\nwind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and\noutrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as\nobjects, not as agents. Theres a most special, a most cunning, oh, a\nmost malicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that\ntheres something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm\nTrade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in\nstrong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark,\nhowever the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest\nMississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go\nat last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly\nblow my good ship on; these Trades, or something like themsomething so\nunchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it!\nAloft there! What dye see?",
  "Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun!\nAye, aye, it must be so. Ive oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye,\nhes chasing _me_ now; not I, _him_thats bad; I might have known it,\ntoo. Fool! the linesthe harpoons hes towing. Aye, aye, I have run him\nby last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look\nouts! Man the braces!",
  "Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw, murmured Starbuck to\nhimself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. God\nkeep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside\nwet my flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!",
  "A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held\nlong breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the\nweather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the\nthree mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had\nvoiced it.",
  "Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck\nthere!brace sharper up; crowd her into the winds eye. Hes too far\noff to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that\nhelmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But\nlet me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; theres\ntime for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and\nnot changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of\nNantucket! The same!the same!the same to Noah as to me. Theres a\nsoft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead\nsomewhereto something else than common land, more palmy than the\npalms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then;\nthe better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old\nmast-head! Whats this?green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks.\nNo such green weather stains on Ahabs head! Theres the difference now\nbetween mans old age and matters. But aye, old mast, we both grow old\ntogether; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a\nleg, thats all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live\nflesh every way. I cant compare with it; and Ive known some ships\nmade of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital\nstuff of vital fathers. Whats that he said? he should still go before\nme, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at\nthe bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and\nall night Ive been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye,\naye, like many more thou toldst direful truth as touching thyself, O\nParsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-headkeep\na good eye upon the whale, the while Im gone. Well talk to-morrow,\nnay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and\ntail.",
  "Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when\nnumbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath\nthe hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time\nthey dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with\ntheir bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats\nin those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them\nin the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of\nmarching regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that\nhad been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first\ndescried; and whether it was that Ahabs crew were all such\ntiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the\nsenses of the sharksa matter sometimes well known to affect\nthem,however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without\nmolesting the others.",
  "Heart of wrought steel! murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and\nfollowing with his eyes the receding boatcanst thou yet ring boldly\nto that sight?lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by\nthem, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?For\nwhen three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be\nsure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the\nevening and the end of that thingbe that end what it may. Oh! my God!\nwhat is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet\nexpectant,fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me,\nas in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.\nMary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see\nbut thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem\nclearing; but clouds sweep betweenIs my journeys end coming? My legs\nfeel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,beats\nit yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!stave it offmove, move! speak\naloud!Mast-head there! See ye my boys hand on the hill?Crazed;aloft\nthere!keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:mark well the whale!Ho!\nagain!drive off that hawk! see! he peckshe tears the vanepointing\nto the red flag flying at the main-truckHa! he soars away with\nit!Wheres the old man now? seest thou that sight, oh Ahab!shudder,\nshudder!",
  "The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-headsa\ndownward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but\nintending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a\nlittle sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the\nprofoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered\nagainst the opposing bow.",
  "Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then\nquickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice,\nswiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a\nsubterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with\ntrailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,\nbut obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist,\nit hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping\nback into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for\nan instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of\nflakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the\nmarble trunk of the whale.",
  "Give way! cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to\nthe attack; but maddened by yesterdays fresh irons that corroded in\nhim, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell\nfrom heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad\nwhite forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;\nas head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more\nflailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two\nmates boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,\nbut leaving Ahabs almost without a scar.",
  "While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the\nwhale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he\nshot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round\nand round to the fishs back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in\nwhich, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of\nthe lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his\nsable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old\nAhab.",
  "Befooled, befooled!drawing in a long lean breathAye, Parsee! I see\nthee again.Aye, and thou goest before; and this, _this_ then is the\nhearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of\nthy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those\nboats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me;\nif not, Ahab is enough to dieDown, men! the first thing that but\noffers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are\nnot other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.Wheres the\nwhale? gone down again?",
  "But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the\ncorpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter\nhad been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again\nsteadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,which thus\nfar had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the\npresent her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his\nutmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight\npath in the sea.",
  "Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled\nto leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding\nby the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbucks face as he\nleaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and\nfollow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,\nhe saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three\nmast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats\nwhich had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in\nrepairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he\nsped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying\nthemselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all\nthis; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers\nseemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking\nthat the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to\nTashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another\nflag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.",
  "Whether fagged by the three days running chase, and the resistance to\nhis swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some\nlatent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White\nWhales way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly\nnearing him once more; though indeed the whales last start had not\nbeen so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves\nthe unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to\nthe boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades\nbecame jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at\nalmost every dip.",
  "They will last long enough! pull on!But who can tellhe\nmutteredwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on\nAhab?But pull on! Aye, all alive, nowwe near him. The helm! take the\nhelm! let me pass,and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward\nto the bows of the still flying boat.",
  "At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with\nthe White Whales flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its\nadvanceas the whale sometimes willand Ahab was fairly within the\nsmoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whales spout, curled\nround his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,\nwith body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the\npoise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the\nhated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked\ninto a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his\nnigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so\nsuddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated\npart of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have\nbeen tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmenwho foreknew\nnot the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for\nits effectsthese were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two\nof them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a\ncombing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man\nhelplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.",
  "Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\ninstantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering\nsea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with\nthe line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their\nseats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line\nfelt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!",
  "Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled\nround to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,\ncatching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing\nin it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking itit may bea\nlarger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing\nprow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.",
  "But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the\nsledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks\nburst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat\nlay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew,\ntrying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.",
  "Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtegos mast-head hammer\nremained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as\nwith a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own\nforward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the\nbowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon\nas he.",
  "The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of\nair, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a\nwomans fainting fit. Up helm, I sayye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is\nthis the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?\nOh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up\nhelm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on\ntowards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me\nnow!",
  "Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now\nhelp Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning\nwhale! Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubbs own\nunwinking eye? And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is\nall too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee,\nthou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins\nof as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would\nyet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh!\nthou grinning whale, but therell be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye\nnot, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his\ndrawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;cherries!\ncherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!",
  "From the ships bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,\nbits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their\nhands, just as they had darted from their various employments; all\ntheir enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side\nstrangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of\noverspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution,\nswift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of\nall that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead\nsmote the ships starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell\nflat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the\nharpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach,\nthey heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.",
  "I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy\nhammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel;\nand only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and\nPole-pointed prow,death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and\nwithout me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest\nshipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel\nmy topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your\nfurthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone\nlife, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll,\nthou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with\nthee; from hells heart I stab at thee; for hates sake I spit my last\nbreath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!\nand since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still\nchasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! _Thus_, I give up\nthe spear!",
  "The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting\nvelocity the line ran through the grooves;ran foul. Ahab stooped to\nclear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the\nneck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was\nshot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the\nheavy eye-splice in the ropes final end flew out of the stark-empty\ntub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its\ndepths.",
  "For an instant, the tranced boats crew stood still; then turned. The\nship? Great God, where is the ship? Soon they through dim, bewildering\nmediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata\nMorgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by\ninfatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the\npagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.\nAnd now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its\ncrew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning,\nanimate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the\nsmallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.",
  "But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the\nsunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the\nerect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,\nwhich calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying\nbillows they almost touched;at that instant, a red arm and a hammer\nhovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the\nflag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that\ntauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home\namong the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;\nthis bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between\nthe hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial\nthrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his\nhammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic\nshrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive\nform folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like\nSatan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of\nheaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.",
  "It so chanced, that after the Parsees disappearance, I was he whom the\nFates ordained to take the place of Ahabs bowsman, when that bowsman\nassumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three\nmen were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So,\nfloating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it,\nwhen the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but\nslowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had\nsubsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting\ntowards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly\nwheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that\nvital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by\nreason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising\nwith great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea,\nfell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost\none whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The\nunharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths;\nthe savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a\nsail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the\ndevious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing\nchildren, only found another orphan.",
  "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, and what is the use of a book, thought Alice\nwithout pictures or conversations?",
  "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.",
  "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, Oh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late! (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.",
  "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled ORANGE MARMALADE, but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.",
  "Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? I wonder how\nmany miles Ive fallen by this time? she said aloud. I must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) yes, thats about the right distancebut\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Ive got to? (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)",
  "Presently she began again. I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnt sound at all\nthe right word) but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Maam, is this New Zealand or Australia?\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy _curtseying_ as youre\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) And what\nan ignorant little girl shell think me for asking! No, itll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.",
  "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. Dinahll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\n(Dinah was the cat.) I hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, Im afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thats\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder? And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats? and\nsometimes, Do bats eat cats? for, you see, as she couldnt answer\neither question, it didnt much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\nNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat? when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.",
  "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, Oh my ears\nand whiskers, how late its getting! She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof.",
  "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alices\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",
  "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\nthrough the doorway; and even if my head would go through, thought\npoor Alice, it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\nknew how to begin. For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\nindeed were really impossible.",
  "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (which certainly was not here\nbefore, said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\nlabel, with the words DRINK ME, beautifully printed on it in large\nletters.",
  "It was all very well to say Drink me, but the wise little Alice was\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. No, Ill look first, she said,\nand see whether its marked _poison_ or not; for she had read\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\nbottle marked poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you,\nsooner or later.",
  "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\nshe felt a little nervous about this; for it might end, you know,\nsaid Alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\nwonder what I should be like then? And she tried to fancy what the\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.",
  "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\nsat down and cried.",
  "Come, theres no use in crying like that! said Alice to herself,\nrather sharply; I advise you to leave off this minute! She generally\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\nBut its no use now, thought poor Alice, to pretend to be two\npeople! Why, theres hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\nperson!",
  "Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\nEAT ME were beautifully marked in currants. Well, Ill eat it, said\nAlice, and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way Ill\nget into the garden, and I dont care which happens!",
  "She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, Which way? Which\nway?, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\non in the common way.",
  "Curiouser and curiouser! cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); now Im\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). Oh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? Im\nsure _I_ shant be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;but I must be\nkind to them, thought Alice, or perhaps they wont walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: Ill give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.",
  "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, said Alice, a great girl like\nyou, (she might well say this), to go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you! But she went on all the same, shedding\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.",
  "After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, Oh! the Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! wont she be savage if Ive kept her waiting! Alice felt\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, If you please,\nsir The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.",
  "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: Dear, dear! How\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\nI wonder if Ive been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different. But if Im not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, _thats_ the great puzzle! And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.",
  "Im sure Im not Ada, she said, for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all; and Im sure I cant\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, _shes_ she, and _Im_ I, andoh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! Ill try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven isoh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesnt signify: lets try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Romeno, _thats_ all wrong, Im certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! Ill try and say _How doth the little_ and she\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\ndid not come the same as they used to do:",
  "Im sure those are not the right words, said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on, I must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, Ive\nmade up my mind about it; if Im Mabel, Ill stay down here! Itll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying Come up again, dear!\nI shall only look up and say Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, Ill come up: if not, Ill stay down\nhere till Im somebody elsebut, oh dear! cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!",
  "As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbits little white kid gloves while\nshe was talking. How _can_ I have done that? she thought. I must be\ngrowing small again. She got up and went to the table to measure\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.",
  "That _was_ a narrow escape! said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; and\nnow for the garden! and she ran with all speed back to the little\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, and things are worse than\never, thought the poor child, for I never was so small as this\nbefore, never! And I declare its too bad, that it is!",
  "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that case I can go back by\nrailway, she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high.",
  "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.",
  "Would it be of any use, now, thought Alice, to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, theres no harm in trying. So she\nbegan: O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse! (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brothers Latin Grammar, A mouseof\na mouseto a mousea mouseO mouse!) The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.",
  "Perhaps it doesnt understand English, thought Alice; I daresay its\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror. (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: O est ma chatte? which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright. Oh, I beg your pardon! cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animals feelings. I quite forgot you didnt like\ncats.",
  "Well, perhaps not, said Alice in a soothing tone: dont be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think youd\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing, Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurseand shes such a capital one for catching miceoh, I beg your\npardon! cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. We wont talk\nabout her any more if youd rather not.",
  "I wont indeed! said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation. Are youare you fondofof dogs? The Mouse did not\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: There is such a nice little dog near\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And itll fetch things when\nyou throw them, and itll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\nof thingsI cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says its so useful, its worth a hundred pounds! He says\nit kills all the rats andoh dear! cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\nIm afraid Ive offended it again! For the Mouse was swimming away\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\npool as it went.",
  "So she called softly after it, Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwont talk about cats or dogs either, if you dont like them! When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice, Let us get to the shore, and then Ill tell you my\nhistory, and youll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.",
  "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",
  "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, I am\nolder than you, and must know better; and this Alice would not allow\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.",
  "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out, Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _Ill_ soon make\nyou dry enough! They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.",
  "Ahem! said the Mouse with an important air, are you all ready? This\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! William\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\nMercia and Northumbria",
  "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, found\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\nthe crown. Williams conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\nof his Normans How are you getting on now, my dear? it continued,\nturning to Alice as it spoke.",
  "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (the exact\nshape doesnt matter, it said,) and then all the party were placed\nalong the course, here and there. There was no One, two, three, and\naway, but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out The race is over! and they all\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, But who has won?",
  "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\nsaid, _Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.",
  "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.",
  "Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, Let us both\ngo to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.Come, Ill take no\ndenial; We must have a trial: For really this morning Ive\nnothing to do. Said the mouse to the cur, Such a trial, dear\nsir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.\nIll be judge, Ill be jury, Said cunning old Fury: Ill\ntry the whole cause, and condemn you to death.",
  "What a pity it wouldnt stay! sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\nher daughter Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\n_your_ temper! Hold your tongue, Ma! said the young Crab, a little\nsnappishly. Youre enough to try the patience of an oyster!",
  "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\nDinahs our cat. And shes such a capital one for catching mice you\ncant think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\nshell eat a little bird as soon as look at it!",
  "This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\ncarefully, remarking, I really must be getting home; the night-air\ndoesnt suit my throat! and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\nto its children, Come away, my dears! Its high time you were all in\nbed! On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\nalone.",
  "I wish I hadnt mentioned Dinah! she said to herself in a melancholy\ntone. Nobody seems to like her, down here, and Im sure shes the best\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\nany more! And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\ncoming back to finish his story.",
  "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\nit muttering to itself The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\nmy fur and whiskers! Shell get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder? Alice guessed in a\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\nthey were nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\nlittle door, had vanished completely.",
  "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\na fan! Quick, now! And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\nmistake it had made.",
  "He took me for his housemaid, she said to herself as she ran. How\nsurprised hell be when he finds out who I am! But Id better take him\nhis fan and glovesthat is, if I can find them. As she said this, she\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\nplate with the name W. RABBIT, engraved upon it. She went in without\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\nfan and gloves.",
  "How queer it seems, Alice said to herself, to be going messages for\na rabbit! I suppose Dinahll be sending me on messages next! And she\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: Miss Alice! Come\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk! Coming in a minute,\nnurse! But Ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out. Only I\ndont think, Alice went on, that theyd let Dinah stop in the house\nif it began ordering people about like that!",
  "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\nthis time with the words DRINK ME, but nevertheless she uncorked it\nand put it to her lips. I know _something_ interesting is sure to\nhappen, she said to herself, whenever I eat or drink anything; so\nIll just see what this bottle does. I do hope itll make me grow large\nagain, for really Im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!",
  "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\ndown the bottle, saying to herself Thats quite enoughI hope I shant\ngrow any moreAs it is, I cant get out at the doorI do wish I hadnt\ndrunk quite so much!",
  "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself Now I\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?",
  "It was much pleasanter at home, thought poor Alice, when one wasnt\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadnt gone down that rabbit-holeand yetand\nyetits rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\nwhen I grow up, Ill write onebut Im grown up now, she added in a\nsorrowful tone; at least theres no room to grow up any more _here_.",
  "Mary Ann! Mary Ann! said the voice. Fetch me my gloves this moment!\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.",
  "_That_ you wont! thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.",
  "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\nnow and then; such as, Sure, I dont like it, yer honour, at all, at\nall! Do as I tell you, you coward! and at last she spread out her\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. What a number\nof cucumber-frames there must be! thought Alice. I wonder what\ntheyll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\n_could!_ Im sure _I_ dont want to stay in here any longer!",
  "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\ntalking together: she made out the words: Wheres the other\nladder?Why, I hadnt to bring but one; Bills got the otherBill!\nfetch it here, lad!Here, put em up at this cornerNo, tie em\ntogether firstthey dont reach half high enough yetOh! theyll do\nwell enough; dont be particularHere, Bill! catch hold of this\nropeWill the roof bear?Mind that loose slateOh, its coming down!\nHeads below! (a loud crash)Now, who did that?It was Bill, I\nfancyWhos to go down the chimney?Nay, _I_ shant! _You_ do\nit!_That_ I wont, then!Bills to go downHere, Bill! the master says\nyoure to go down the chimney!",
  "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\nshe heard a little animal (she couldnt guess of what sort it was)\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\nsaying to herself This is Bill, she gave one sharp kick, and waited\nto see what would happen next.",
  "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill!\nthen the Rabbits voice alongCatch him, you by the hedge! then\nsilence, and then another confusion of voicesHold up his headBrandy\nnowDont choke himHow was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\nus all about it!",
  "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, I\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, theyd take the\nroof off. After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, A barrowful will do, to begin with.",
  "A barrowful of _what?_ thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. Ill put a stop to\nthis, she said to herself, and shouted out, Youd better not do that\nagain! which produced another dead silence.",
  "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\nhead. If I eat one of these cakes, she thought, its sure to make\n_some_ change in my size; and as it cant possibly make me larger, it\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.",
  "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\nsafe in a thick wood.",
  "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\ngreat hurry.",
  "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. Poor little\nthing! said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\nspite of all her coaxing.",
  "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.",
  "And yet what a dear little puppy it was! said Alice, as she leant\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\nleaves: I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifif Id\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! Id nearly forgotten that\nIve got to grow up again! Let me seehow _is_ it to be managed? I\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\nquestion is, what?",
  "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\nwas on the top of it.",
  "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\nanything else.",
  "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, So you\nthink youre changed, do you?",
  "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\nOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\ngrow shorter.",
  "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.",
  "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\nlefthand bit.",
  "Come, my heads free at last! said Alice in a tone of delight, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.",
  "What _can_ all that green stuff be? said Alice. And where _have_ my\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I cant see you?\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",
  "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.",
  "A likely story indeed! said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. Ive seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! Youre a serpent; and theres\nno use denying it. I suppose youll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!",
  "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, Youre\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\nme whether youre a little girl or a serpent?",
  "Well, be off, then! said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.",
  "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\nand began talking to herself, as usual. Come, theres half my plan\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! Im never sure what Im\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, Ive got back to my\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenhow\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder? As she said this, she came suddenly\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\nWhoever lives there, thought Alice, itll never do to come upon them\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits! So she\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",
  "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\nfish)and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.",
  "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, For the Duchess. An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet. The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, From the Queen.\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.",
  "Theres no sort of use in knocking, said the Footman, and that for\ntwo reasons. First, because Im on the same side of the door as you\nare; secondly, because theyre making such a noise inside, no one could\npossibly hear you. And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\nnoise going on withina constant howling and sneezing, and every now\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\npieces.",
  "There might be some sense in your knocking, the Footman went on\nwithout attending to her, if we had the door between us. For instance,\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\nknow. He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. But perhaps he cant help it,\nshe said to herself; his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.How am I to get in?\nshe repeated, aloud.",
  "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.",
  "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moments pause. The only things in the kitchen\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.",
  "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\nthe Duchess and the babythe fire-irons came first; then followed a\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.",
  "Which would _not_ be an advantage, said Alice, who felt very glad to\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. Just\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis",
  "Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like! the Duchess said to Alice,\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. I must go and get ready to play\ncroquet with the Queen, and she hurried out of the room. The cook\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.",
  "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\njust like a star-fish, thought Alice. The poor little thing was\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",
  "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\nout into the open air. If I dont take this child away with me,\nthought Alice, theyre sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldnt it be\nmurder to leave it behind? She said the last words out loud, and the\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\nDont grunt, said Alice; thats not at all a proper way of\nexpressing yourself.",
  "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\nnot like the look of the thing at all. But perhaps it was only\nsobbing, she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\nwere any tears.",
  "No, there were no tears. If youre going to turn into a pig, my dear,\nsaid Alice, seriously, Ill have nothing more to do with you. Mind\nnow! The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.",
  "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, Now, what am I to do\nwith this creature when I get it home? when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\nfurther.",
  "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood. If it had grown up, she said to\nherself, it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think. And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself, if one only knew the right way to change them when she\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\na tree a few yards off.",
  "Cheshire Puss, she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\nwider. Come, its pleased so far, thought Alice, and she went on.\nWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",
  "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. Ive seen hatters before, she\nsaid to herself; the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\nperhaps as this is May it wont be raving madat least not so mad as it\nwas in March. As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.",
  "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\ntimidly, saying to herself Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\nI almost wish Id gone to see the Hatter instead!",
  "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. Very\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse, thought Alice; only, as its asleep,\nI suppose it doesnt mind.",
  "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\none corner of it: No room! No room! they cried out when they saw\nAlice coming. Theres _plenty_ of room! said Alice indignantly, and\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.",
  "Ah! that accounts for it, said the Hatter. He wont stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, hed do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine oclock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: youd only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!",
  "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\nmoved into the Dormouses place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.",
  "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\nlittle shriek, and went on: that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchnessyou know you say\nthings are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?",
  "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe teapot.",
  "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\nglass table. Now, Ill manage better this time, she said to herself,\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_she found\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\nand the cool fountains.",
  "A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\none of them say, Look out now, Five! Dont go splashing paint over me\nlike that!",
  "Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\nvoice, Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\nyou see, Miss, were doing our best, afore she comes, to At this\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\nout The Queen! The Queen! and the three gardeners instantly threw\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",
  "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.",
  "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions; and besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession, thought she, if people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldnt see it? So she stood still where she was,\nand waited.",
  "And who are _these?_ said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.",
  "Get to your places! shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",
  "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.",
  "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\nshouting Off with his head! or Off with her head! about once in a\nminute.",
  "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\nand then, thought she, what would become of me? Theyre dreadfully\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that theres any\none left alive!",
  "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\nto herself Its the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.",
  "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. Its no use\nspeaking to it, she thought, till its ears have come, or at least one\nof them. In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",
  "I dont think they play at all fairly, Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone, and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear\noneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular; at\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to themand youve no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, theres the\narch Ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\ngroundand I should have croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now, only\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!",
  "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\non, as she heard the Queens voice in the distance, screaming with\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.",
  "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",
  "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: but it doesnt\nmatter much, thought Alice, as all the arches are gone from this side\nof the ground. So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\nfriend.",
  "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.",
  "The Cats head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.",
  "When _Im_ a Duchess, she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\ntone though), I wont have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\ndoes very well withoutMaybe its always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered, she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\nkind of rule, and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes\nthem bitterandand barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldnt be\nso stingy about it, you know",
  "She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. Youre thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I cant\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\na bit.",
  "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\nright height to rest her chin upon Alices shoulder, and it was an\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\nbore it as well as she could.",
  "I quite agree with you, said the Duchess; and the moral of that\nisBe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more\nsimplyNever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.",
  "But here, to Alices great surprise, the Duchesss voice died away,\neven in the middle of her favourite word moral, and the arm that was\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\nthunderstorm.",
  "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\nwith the other players, and shouting Off with his head! or Off with\nher head! Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\nand under sentence of execution.",
  "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\nyou dont know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) Up, lazy\nthing! said the Queen, and take this young lady to see the Mock\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\nexecutions I have ordered; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\nwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.",
  "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\npitied him deeply. What is his sorrow? she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, Its all\nhis fancy, that: he hasnt got no sorrow, you know. Come on!",
  "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\noccasional exclamation of Hjckrrh! from the Gryphon, and the constant\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\nsaying, Thank you, sir, for your interesting story, but she could not\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\nnothing.",
  "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\nquestion, added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, Drive on, old fellow! Dont be all\nday about it! and he went on in these words:",
  "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\ntwo sobs choked his voice. Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:",
  "You may not have lived much under the sea (I havent, said\nAlice)and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster\n(Alice began to say I once tasted but checked herself hastily, and\nsaid No, never) so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\nLobster Quadrille is!",
  "Will you walk a little faster? said a whiting to a snail.\nTheres a porpoise close behind us, and hes treading on my tail.\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\nThey are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance?\nWill you, wont you, will you, wont you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, wont you, will you, wont you, wont you join the dance?",
  "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\nBut the snail replied Too far, too far! and gave a look askance\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.",
  "What matters it how far we go? his scaly friend replied.\nThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\nWill you, wont you, will you, wont you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, wont you, will you, wont you, wont you join the dance?",
  "Youre wrong about the crumbs, said the Mock Turtle: crumbs would\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\nand the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\neyes.Tell her about the reason and all that, he said to the Gryphon.",
  "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\nabout her repeating _You are old, Father William_, to the\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said Thats very curious.",
  "How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\nthought Alice; I might as well be at school at once. However, she got\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\nvery queer indeed:",
  "[later editions continued as follows\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\nAnd concluded the banquet]",
  "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themI wish theyd\nget the trial done, she thought, and hand round the refreshments!\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\neverything about her, to pass away the time.",
  "And thats the jury-box, thought Alice, and those twelve creatures,\n(she was obliged to say creatures, you see, because some of them were\nanimals, and some were birds,) I suppose they are the jurors. She\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, jury-men\nwould have done just as well.",
  "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\nthat all the jurors were writing down stupid things! on their slates,\nand she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell\nstupid, and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. A nice\nmuddle their slatesll be in before the trials over! thought Alice.",
  "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.",
  "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\nas long as there was room for her.",
  "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\nof the court, Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\noff.",
  "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)",
  "Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, for they\nhavent got much evidence _yet_, she said to herself. Imagine her\nsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\nlittle voice, the name Alice!",
  "Here! cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\ngoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.",
  "Oh, I _beg_ your pardon! she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\nof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\nidea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\njury-box, or they would die.",
  "Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\ngot it out again, and put it right; not that it signifies much, she\nsaid to herself; I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\ntrial one way up as the other.",
  "As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\ncourt.",
  "If theres no meaning in it, said the King, that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we neednt try to find any. And yet I dont\nknow, he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\nthem with one eye; I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\n_said I could not swim_ you cant swim, can you? he added, turning\nto the Knave.",
  "Never! said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\nas it lasted.)",
  "At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.",
  "Oh, Ive had such a curious dream! said Alice, and she told her\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, It _was_ a curious\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; its getting late.\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.",
  "First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\nlooking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice, and\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\nthat _would_ always get into her eyesand still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\nstrange creatures of her little sisters dream.",
  "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried bythe\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolshe\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pig-baby\nwas sneezing on the Duchesss knee, while plates and dishes crashed\naround itonce more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\nLizards slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\nTurtle.",
  "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull realitythe grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsthe rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queens shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boyand the sneeze of the baby, the\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yardwhile the\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\nTurtles heavy sobs.",
  "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\ndays."
